# Sims 3 modernization

Make The Sims 3 run well on modern PCs: less in-game stutter, fewer Error 12 (out of address space) crashes, and room for heavy store content and custom content (CC). First we collect and measure what the community fixes already do, then we reverse engineer the game and build our own fixes where those fall short: a C# script mod, a native ASI plugin, and the test tools to prove each change.

Target: The Sims 3 **Steam** edition, patch 1.67, all expansion and stuff packs, Windows 10/11. The Origin / EA app version is not supported.

**Just want to play with the fixes?** Download the latest [release](https://github.com/rodneypantonial/sims3-modernization/releases) and follow [docs/PLAYERS.md](docs/PLAYERS.md): what's switched on, and how to install it in a few steps.

**Status:** research project. Latest release: **v0.1.5** (2026-10-24): fewer freezes in specific situations (Sims getting off boats, crowds, the 3 AM stuck-Sim check, NRaas Overwatch's nightly clean-up, NRaas ErrorTrap's after-load check) and a crash fix near water, on top of v0.1.4's background route planning and the earlier save and stutter fixes. Results are measured on one laptop (i7-11800H, 32 GB, RTX 3070 Laptop GPU). They are not yet confirmed on other machines; that is one of the things contributors can help with.

`PLAN.md` is the source of truth for what is done, what is open and what comes next.

## Results so far

Measured with the harness (`tools/harness/profile-world.ts`), 10 minutes of play at speed 3, on aged 14-day test saves. **Baseline** = the community fixes layer (DXVK, S3SS, NRaas, Smooth Patch, routing fixes, ...; see `tools/setup/fixes.json`) without our mods. The unmodified game cannot reliably load a save on this machine at all: it runs out of address space while loading (docs/05).

**Release v0.1.5 vs v0.1.4 vs no fixes of ours, freezes in normal play:** a freeze here is a sim step of 300 ms (about a third of a second) or longer, the hitches you notice. Each cell is one 10-minute seeded run per town (one load each), so small differences are within noise. Cells: no fixes -> v0.1.4 -> **v0.1.5**.

| | Bridgeport | Sunset Valley | Isla Paradiso |
|---|---|---|---|
| freezes of 300 ms or longer, per 10 minutes | 4.8 -> 5.8 -> **5.0** | 13.7 -> 4.8 -> **4.3** | 93.9 -> 23.1 -> **20.0** |
| worst freeze | 441 -> 308 -> **324 ms** | 437 -> 323 -> **520 ms** | 895 -> 405 -> **573 ms** |
| p99 sim step (99% of steps are shorter) | 79 -> 76 -> **79 ms** | 59 -> n/a -> **67 ms** | 168 -> 78 -> **105 ms** |

The Sunset Valley v0.1.4 value comes from one run with other programs using the machine, and has no p99.

Read it as: in normal play v0.1.5 is about the same as v0.1.4, and both are far smoother than no fixes of ours in Isla Paradiso (about 94 freezes per 10 minutes without, 20-23 with). v0.1.5's gains are in specific situations, measured in forced test scenarios (the same situation set up on purpose, fix off vs on):

- Sims getting off a boat in Isla Paradiso: one 8.3 s freeze -> none.
- Crowds: fewer freezes of 300 ms or longer (7 -> 2 in one test, 6 -> 5 in the release test: small, within noise).
- 3 AM stuck-Sim check: worst freeze 1.2 s -> 0.14 s.
- NRaas Overwatch nightly clean-up: worst freeze 0.3 s -> 0.1 s.
- NRaas ErrorTrap check after loading a save: worst freeze 0.28 s -> 0.06 s.
- Plus a crash fix: the game could crash when a Sim looked for a spot on the shore while routes were being planned in the background.

**Long play (45 minutes on v0.1.5):** Bridgeport had no freeze longer than 0.5 s. Sunset Valley had 4 freezes of 1 s or longer, the worst 3.6 s; they come from route plans the game still runs on its main thread when one Sim plans for another. v0.1.4 has the same kind on the same save and seed (3 of 1 s or longer, worst 1.7 s). This is the main target for the next release.

**Release check for v0.1.5:** 22 of 22 tests passed, 0 crashes: smoke play in all three towns, the save matrix plus reload in Bridgeport, a trip to France, each new fix forced on, the whole fix set off vs on in forced scenarios, two water scenarios, and a 45-minute Bridgeport soak.

**Release v0.1.4 (`ts3native` 0.36.0 + `ts3fixes`, as shipped) vs no fixes of ours, 2026-10-20/21:** same machine and saves, seeded (12345), ABBA order, 4 runs per side on Bridgeport and Sunset Valley, 2 on Isla Paradiso. "No fixes" = the same `ts3native.asi` with every section we ship switched off and every `ts3fixes` switch off (only the walk-style comparer stays, it has no switch). Queues `release-vs-baseline*.json`, report `node tools/release-vs-baseline-report.ts`.

| | Bridgeport | Sunset Valley | Isla Paradiso |
|---|---|---|---|
| stutters per minute (sim iterations >= 50 ms) | 177 -> **152** (-14%) | 76 -> **70** (-7%) | 146 -> **117** (-20%) |
| p99 iteration | 93 -> **84 ms** (-10%) | 56 -> 57 ms (+2%) | 194 -> **107 ms** (-45%) |
| worst iteration | 1,482 -> 1,985 ms (+34%) | 1,062 -> 2,518 ms (+137%) | 7,258 -> **636 ms** (-91%) |
| route planning on the sim thread | 129 -> **53 ms/s** (-59%) | 79 -> **24 ms/s** (-70%) | 282 -> **92 ms/s** (-67%) |
| game time per real second | 10.2 -> 10.2 min (0%) | 13.1 -> 13.1 min (0%) | 11.0 -> **12.4 min** (+13%) |

Read it as: smoother everywhere, faster only where the game was falling behind. Bridgeport and Sunset Valley already run at the speed-3 cap without our fixes, so game time per second cannot rise there; Isla Paradiso was lagging and gains 13%. The worse worst frames on Bridgeport and Sunset Valley are single route plans of about 1 s that the background planner refuses and runs on the main thread (`NoStart`). v0.1.5 does not change them yet; they are the next release's main target. Several runs had other programs at 10-18% of the game's CPU cores, so treat differences under ~5% as noise.

**Earlier result, `ts3fixes` only (2026-10-12, build 62c39f6, docs/04 F13), 3 runs per world:**

| | Bridgeport | Sunset Valley | Isla Paradiso |
|---|---|---|---|
| sim iterations/s | 31.2 -> **50.1** (+61%) | 63.3 -> **116.8** (+85%) | 31.7 -> **73.8** (+133%) |
| hitches/s (sim iterations >= 50 ms) | 4.03 -> **2.46** (-39%) | 1.90 -> **1.00** (-47%) | 3.49 -> **1.70** (-51%) |
| worst iteration | 1,014 -> 468 ms | 2,210 -> 2,885 ms | 1,170 -> 676 ms |
| route search ms/s | 94.9 -> 107.8 | 82.2 -> 77.3 | 246.4 -> 183.5 |

Repeat Bridgeport runs on later builds land at 37.8-41 iterations/s (+25-30%) and 2.6-2.8 hitches/s (-30%); the single 50.1 run is treated as an outlier (docs/04 F16). Best Bridgeport so far: 38.8 it/s, 2.68 hitches/s (2026-10-13). Sunset Valley and Isla Paradiso have not been re-measured since F13; a milestone run is planned.

**Single fixes and experiments (Bridgeport, in-load A/B: the fix switches on and off every 2 minutes in one 10-minute load):**

| Change | Result | Date / source |
|---|---|---|
| Route fixes for unseen townies (ts3fixes) | 40.8 vs 34.9 it/s, hitches 2.57 vs 3.36/s, worst iteration 402 vs 857 ms | 2026-10-12, docs/04 F16 |
| Bigger GC heap 40 -> 352 MB (ts3native `[GC]`) | forced collections 128 -> 1 in 6 min, forced GC 13.9 -> 0.1 ms/s, hitches -14% | 2026-10-12, docs/04 F15 (3 x 6 min, not in-load) |
| Allocator cache (ts3native `[Alloc]`, experimental) | 30.7 vs 25.7 it/s (**+19%**), hitches -28%; repeat 32.5 vs 29.7 (+9%), hitches -10%, but worst iteration and route fails higher in both; one unexplained crash in a session with it on | 2026-10-13/14, PLAN.md |
| Lot object query cache (ts3fixes `kSpatialCache`) | 34.8 vs 33.0 it/s (+5%), hitches -7%; repeat 25.7 vs 27.4 (-6%), hitches +17% | 2026-10-13/14, PLAN.md |
| Fewer route plans (`kRoutableCache` + `kStuckCheckBusy`) | no measurable change (38.8 vs 38.2 it/s); repeat 38.0 vs 44.3 (-14%), 0 busy Sims skipped | 2026-10-13/14, PLAN.md |

**Other results:**

- **Address space (Error 12):** DXVK alone frees about 1.75 GB on a fresh save (vanilla: 176 MB largest free block after load and an out-of-memory crash; DXVK: 1,853 MB) [measured, docs/05]. The Sims 3 Performance Patch (S3PP 2.1) frees another ~70 MB with heavy store content (committed -71 MB, largest free block +64 MB); its string cache broke no labels in our check [measured, docs/17 §8-9].
- **Frame rate (test B, Bridgeport, current build, 2 runs, 2026-10-13):** 56.6 / 59.0 FPS, p99 frame 39.2 / 33.1 ms, p99.9 98.4 / 42.1 ms; 21 of 23 long frames overlapped a sim-thread hitch. No baseline FPS yet.
- **Stuck Sims:** treated as solved (2026-10-13): many 10-minute runs with 0 real stuck Sims. New cases are only logged (`docs/data/stuck-log.md`).
- **Save cleanup (opt-in):** on a Bridgeport test save, -266 weak townie relationships and -9 stray other-world Sims, households and Sims unchanged, a second run removes nothing, the save reloads clean (docs/14).
- **Heavy store content:** CC + store repacks add ~29 s to a cold load and ~100 MB address space; load time is the main cost, not stutter (docs/17 §6).
- **Online features:** with our settings the game makes no network calls while playing (docs/16).
- **Faster saving (v0.1.2/v0.1.3):** Bridgeport 12.7 -> 10.3 s (-19%), Sunset Valley -17% to -24%, Isla Paradiso -14% to -23%; same save file; 27 of 28 save tests PASS, 1 test-tool fail (fixed) ([CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).
- **Routing off the sim thread (on by default since v0.1.4):** route planning on a worker thread halves the sim thread's own routing time (about 116 -> 57 ms per second in Bridgeport). Measured results per release are under Results so far ([docs/84](docs/84-async-wait-sites.md), `PLAN.md`).

All numbers come from one machine and one set of saves. Treat percentages as "this is what we saw", not as a promise.

## What is in the repo

| Layer | Path | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Community fixes installer | `tools/setup/install-fixes.ts`, `fixes.json` | Installs the known community fixes from their official sources (never re-hosted), checks SHA-256, backs up every file it replaces, `uninstall` restores. Also `check-conflicts.ts` (clashing mods) and `content-health.ts` (read-only CC check). |
| `ts3fixes` player mod | `mods/ts3fixes` | C# script mod (one `.package`). Replaces a few game methods at startup: off-screen trip shortcuts, route fixes, stuck watchdog, broadcaster throttle, optional save cleanup and caches. One tuning switch per fix. See `mods/ts3fixes/README.md`. |
| `ts3native` ASI plugin | `native/ts3native` | 32-bit native plugin loaded by Ultimate ASI Loader. GC heap patches and faster water route search, plus opt-in experiments (route cache, route worker, allocator cache, faster decompression, save write). Every patch checks the original bytes first and skips itself on a different exe. Settings in `ts3native.ini`. |
| `ts3agent` test agent | `mods/ts3agent` | In-game script mod that lets our tools read and drive the game (load saves, place Sims, trigger routes, switch fixes, count things). Test-only, never for players. Forked from Sims3-MCP (MIT). |
| Probe and harness | `tools/probe`, `tools/frida`, `tools/harness` | Frida-based probe server (memory, stacks, native counters), stutter profiler, frame-time hook, repro library, profiling and A/B runs, crash and change ledgers. |
| Research | `docs/01`-`docs/85` | Community fixes compared, reverse-engineering findings (native and C#), designs, measurements. Raw data in `docs/data`. |

### What we ship vs what is only for setup

- **We ship only our own fixes:** `ts3fixes.package` and `ts3native`, as GitHub releases with player notes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- **Community fixes are not part of the product.** The installer (`tools/setup/install-fixes.ts`) sets them up only so that developers and testers get the same game setup we measure against, with one command and as little manual work as possible. They are downloaded from their authors' own pages, never re-hosted or copied into this repo, and stay their authors' work (credits below).

## Status of each fix

| Fix | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Community fixes layer (DXVK, S3SS, NRaas ErrorTrap/Overwatch, Smooth Patch, MonoPatcher, routing fixes, ...) | installer, default set | **on by default**, measured |
| Sims 3 Performance Patch 2.1 (S3PP) | installer `s3pp` | **on by default** (manual download), label check passed |
| Trip shortcuts, route fixes for unseen townies, stuck watchdog, broadcaster throttle, walk-style comparer, portal adaptor leak | `ts3fixes` | **on by default** (`stutter-fixes`) |
| Save cleanup (`kSaveCleanup`) | `ts3fixes` | **opt-in**, verified on one save each (relationships and other-world Sims; empty life-event lists: -26,161, save OK) |
| Lot object query cache (`kSpatialCache`) | `ts3fixes` | **opt-in**, +5% then -6% in two A/Bs: no gain |
| `kRoutableCache`, `kStuckCheckBusy` | `ts3fixes` | **opt-in**, no measurable gain |
| Create-a-Sim hair/makeup grid (`kCasGrid`) | `ts3fixes` | **experimental**, failed in game 2026-10-14: hair still freezes 4.1 s (4.8 s off) before the first tile |
| GC heap and growth step (`[GC]`) | `ts3native` | **on by default** (stable build, release v0.1.0), measured: forced GCs 128 -> 1 in 6 min in Bridgeport |
| Water route search (`[WaterJps]`) | `ts3native` | **on by default** (stable build, release v0.1.0), verified in game: 5.4M searches compared with the game's own code in Isla Paradiso, 0 mismatches |
| Allocator cache (`[Alloc]`) | `ts3native` | **experimental**: +19% and +9% in two A/Bs, but worse worst-case iterations and route fails; crash suspect, needs a long stability run |
| Route worker, synchronous (`[RouteWorker]`) | `ts3native` | **experimental**: stable in game, no speed gain on its own |
| Async route plan (`[RouteAsync]`, job queue, `[RouteGate]`) | `ts3native` | **on by default since release v0.1.4**: route plans asked by a Sim's own task run on a worker thread; plans for another Sim's task still run on the sim thread (the remaining 1 s+ freezes in Sunset Valley, next release's target) ([docs/84](docs/84-async-wait-sites.md)) |
| Waits left while routing runs off-thread: discourage footprints (`[Discourage]`, design D), read-only steering (`[SteerRO]`, S2), footprint rebuild race fix (`[FpRebuildLock]`, C-A), read-only lot front door (`[LotFrontDoorRO]`, L1) | `ts3native` | `[Discourage]` on by default (v0.1.4; footprint deferral `DeferFootprint=1` since v0.1.5); the others **built, off by default** (0.13.0-0.14.0): proven offline against the game's own code; live shadow and on runs queued ([docs/84](docs/84-async-wait-sites.md)) |
| Route search budget (`[RouteBudget]`) | `ts3native` | **paused**: stranded Sims (41 stuck vs 0) |
| Faster RefPack decoder (`[Decompress]`) | `ts3native` | **on by default** (release v0.1.1), verified in game: 0 mismatches over a full load, ~144k decodes in 4 sessions |
| Save write (`[SaveWrite]`) | `ts3native` | **on by default** (release v0.1.1), verified in game: old-save backup copied by a worker thread, saves reload |
| Route negative cache (`[RouteCache]`) | `ts3native` | **off**: tested in game 2026-10-14, 0.2% hits, no gain |
| Faster save object table (`kFastRefTable`) | `ts3fixes` | **on by default** (release v0.1.3): saves 14-24% faster, same save file, save tests PASS |
| Lighter Sim panel (`kMotiveBarImageCache`, `kBuffGridInPlace`, `kSimNameCache`) | `ts3fixes` | **on by default** (release v0.1.3): UI only, nothing in the save changes |
| Save footprint index, delayed flush, compression timing (`[FootprintIndex]`, `[SaveFlush]`, `[SaveCompress]`) | `ts3native` | **off, opt-in** (release v0.1.2): no gain above save-to-save variation on an NVMe SSD |
| Crash fix: a Sim looking for a spot on the shore while routes plan in the background (`[RouteGate]`) | `ts3native` | **on by default** (release v0.1.5): Isla Paradiso boat-exit scenario, 2 runs of 20 firings each, no crash |
| Moving Sims and objects no longer wait for background route plans (`[Discourage]` `DeferFootprint=1`) | `ts3native` | **on by default** (release v0.1.5): Isla Paradiso boat exit, one 8.3 s freeze -> none |
| Fewer short freezes in crowds (`[RouteAsync]` `RefcountGuard=1`) | `ts3native` | **on by default** (release v0.1.5): crowd scenario: fewer freezes of 300 ms or longer (7 -> 2 and 6 -> 5 in two tests) |
| NRaas Overwatch nightly clean-up in steps (`kOverwatchChain`) | `ts3fixes` | **on by default** (release v0.1.5): worst freeze 0.3 -> 0.1 s |
| 3 AM stuck-Sim check in its own task (`kStuckCheckAsync`) | `ts3fixes` | **on by default** (release v0.1.5): worst freeze 1.2 -> 0.14 s |
| NRaas ErrorTrap after-load check spread out (`kErrorTrapSpread`) | `ts3fixes` | **on by default** (release v0.1.5): worst freeze 0.28 -> 0.06 s |

## Quick start: players

Just want our fixes? Download them from the [releases](https://github.com/rodneypantonial/sims3-modernization/releases) page and follow **[docs/PLAYERS.md](docs/PLAYERS.md)** (copy the script mod into `Mods\Packages`, the native plugin into `Game\Bin`; about five minutes). Every release lists everything that is switched on.

## Quick start: full test install

The steps below set up the full test install (community fixes layer plus `ts3fixes`), the one contributors and testers use.

1. **Back up first:** copy `<Documents>\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\` (saves, Mods, settings) somewhere safe. Keep a copy of `TS3W.exe` as `TS3W.exe.orig` if you ever patch the exe yourself (our tools never do).
2. Install Node.js 22.18 or newer, then clone this repo.
3. See what will be installed and which files you must download by hand (NRaas, ModTheSims and Nexus need a browser):

   ```
   node tools/setup/install-fixes.ts plan
   ```

   Put the manual downloads in `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\ts3-fixes` (or pass `--downloads <dir>`). If the game is not in the default Steam folder, set `TS3_BIN=<SteamLibrary>\steamapps\common\The Sims 3\Game\Bin`.
4. Install the default set and check it:

   ```
   node tools/setup/install-fixes.ts install
   node tools/setup/install-fixes.ts status
   node tools/setup/check-conflicts.ts
   ```

   `stutter-fixes` (our `ts3fixes`) is part of the default set; building it needs the game's script DLLs, see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).
5. To undo: `node tools/setup/install-fixes.ts uninstall` (or `--only <id>`). Backups live in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ts3-fixes`.

Opt-in entries (`native-patches`, `overwatch-no-stuckcheck`, world fixes, ...) are listed by `plan --set all`; install one with `install --only <id>`.

## Quick start: contributors

- [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md): hardware, software, AI model.
- [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md): build the mods and the native plugin, installer usage, `ts3native.ini` switches.
- [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md): how we measure, repro library, A/B runs, crash triage, how to report results.
- [docs/TESTING-AND-BUG-HUNTING.md](docs/TESTING-AND-BUG-HUNTING.md): the test harness in one place and how we chase a crash or hitch down to its cause, with a worked example.
- [docs/MEMORY-RESEARCH.md](docs/MEMORY-RESEARCH.md): start here for memory / Error 12 work: what we measured, the tools, how to run them, open tasks.
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): rules for AI coding agents (and a good summary for humans).
- `PLAN.md`: current state, open items and the next tasks in order. Pick from there or from the GitHub issues.

## Project rules

- **No EA files in git.** No game binaries, packages, extracted or decompiled EA code, saves, dumps or captures. Each contributor works on their own copy of the game. `.gitignore` covers the usual paths; `game-copy/` is for local analysis only.
- **Measure everything.** A fix counts when the harness shows it against the baseline, with build hash and settings. One change at a time; compare in one load with runtime switches where possible.
- **Verified vs inferred.** Every claim in the docs is marked `[verified]` (disassembly, decompiled code or measurement), `[community]` (reported by others) or `[inferred]`. Inferred claims are confirmed before code relies on them.
- **No harm to saves.** Fixes use the game's own functions and end states. Anything that changes save data is opt-in.
- **Respect other authors.** Community mods without a license are studied for behaviour only and never copied or ported; we write our own implementation from a written spec and credit the author.

## License

Code: MIT (`LICENSE`). Documentation (`docs/`, `*.md`): CC BY 4.0 (`LICENSE-docs`). `mods/ts3agent` keeps its upstream MIT notice (`mods/ts3agent/LICENSE`). Third-party fixes installed by the installer keep their own licenses and are downloaded from their authors' pages, never redistributed here.
