// the rest, put back after each job and on exit (pin.ts). Every job samples machine load (machine-load.ts) into
// <queue>-<date>-<job>-machine.jsonl: row.machine (full line), row.noise (low|medium|high) and the short form in the md note.
// Timing verdict (docs/168 §10, run-verdict.ts rowTiming): row.timing valid | valid-half | valid-single | invalid + row.timingWhy (and per
// profile.repros window rr.timing), from the row's noise, verdict, the measurement tools of the ini it ran with and the A/B
// iterations per arm; shown in the md note. hitch-ab.ts --reuse collects valid runs as timing evidence.
// Profile (timing) jobs: ~2.5 min in, other CPU >= 10% or a clock drop over the samples so far stops the job ("noisy machine
// early: ..."); noiseCheck: false skips that for correctness-only jobs. After the run every enabled feature in ACTIVITY must
// show its counter rising and profile.fixesOn its 'fixes on: ... (verified)' line, else the run is void. Profile jobs whose ids
// differ only in the last -part get a WARN pair line (queue log, --dry-run) when profOpts or noSamplers differ (fixesOff left out: on/off arms differ there by design).
// Night runs (TS3_NIGHT=1) and --close-spotify stop Spotify at the start; daytime runs leave it alone (Rodney 2026-10-26).
// Measurement smoke (Rodney 2026-10-25, AGENTS.md Rules): when the selected timing jobs (profile, noiseCheck not false) sum to
// more than SMOKE_OVER_MIN minutes, a real run first runs one smoke job (queue-level "smoke": {job}, else the first timing job
// cut to SMOKE_MIN minutes and its first profile.repros item, id <id>-smoke) as a child queue <queue>-smoke, and stops before
// the long run unless: no timing job has a heavy tool on (hitch-ab.ts toolsOn + docs/data/tool-costs.json: RouteSnap audits,
// samplers, Frida agents, ...), the smoke job passed, every A/B or armed-loop window splits per arm in hitch-ab.ts (runIters)
// and wait-ab.ts, ts3native.log has [P6Waits] arm 0 and 1 lines when the job sets P6Waits.Enabled, and its log has no
// native_set read-back failure. A pass is cached in probe-out/queue/smoke-cache.json by queue file + smoke asi sha256 + last
// tools/harness commit. --no-smoke skips it (correctness-only queues; a queue without timing jobs never smokes).
// Hold (Rodney 2026-10-25): before each job and the smoke job, while probe-out/queue/hold exists (a crash-triage build, hold.ts)
// the queue waits (line every 5 min, warning at 60 min); probe-out/queue/job-running names the running job for hold.ts wait-job-end.
// Noisy rerun: a timing job (profile, noiseCheck not false) stopped by the early noise check or with a high end verdict runs once
// more at the end of the same run as <id>-rerun; both rows are kept and the md note says which one counts.
// Build check (docs/TESTING.md "Build verification", tools/builds.ts, docs/data/builds.json): before every game start Bin/ts3native.asi
// must be the job's asi (sha256; DB entry and version when the DB knows it) and the installed ts3fixes.package tuning digest must be
// fixesBuild's (DB name, job or queue level) or by default build/ts3fixes.package's (and byte-equal to it); after start-up the
// first line of ts3native.log must name that version. A miss FAILs the job with the reason, nothing run; row.buildCheck holds the hashes.
// Save guard: the Baseline-*/Story-* save the job loads and ApexTest-Town are hashed before and after every job (row.saveHashes);
// a change FAILs the job and stops the queue (2026-10-24: Baseline-BP-Spring was overwritten by a manual Save).
// minCounters: the job refuses (error row, nothing measured) when /native after the load reports an older counters version
// than this, i.e. the asi lacks the module the ini switches on (verify.json: [Verify] needs v20). A missing asi refuses
// before the game is touched. The full /native before and after goes to probe-out/queue/<queue>-<date>-<job>-native.json
// (verify-verdicts.ts reads it with the profile files to fill docs/51). With ini Verify.Enabled the dump after the load also
// zeroes the [Verify] maxima (/native?vfresetmax=1, read first), so `after` - `before` and the after maxima cover play only
// (the dump says maxReset: true).
// nativeRequire: "name>=n,..." over the /native after - before of the job (arrays as name.i, e.g. sypPlans.1 = failed sync plans);
// logRequire: { "<regex>": min lines } over the job's ts3native.log copy. Either failing turns the row FAIL (repro event checks, docs/169).
// logForbid: { "<regex>": max lines } over the same copy (0 = the line must not appear, e.g. a replay audit MISMATCH); more turns the row FAIL.
// routingFailFast: { ms, scope: "unseen" | "all", allow?: [{ match, reason, ref }] } (Rodney 2026-10-26, routing-failfast.ts): from the profile
// start, every 30 s, routing above ms (unseen fallback lines; with scope all also sync plans, own-job waits, route-led hitches)
// stops the job at once with FAIL: routing fail-fast: ...; triaged false positives go into routing-failfast-allow.json.
// scriptErrorsMax: N = at most N new ScriptError_*.xml in the user folder since the job start (known EA errors, known-script-errors.json,
// not counted); more turns the row FAIL (docs/191 bp-cc-load-smoke: synthetic CC loads, places and wears without script errors).
// profile: profile-world.ts --tag <queue>-<date>-<job> (--seed: seed_rng at the window start, docs/27); rng-compare.ts reads the rows.
// routelock: autopilot (default ultra) + the probe's /routelock watch for `minutes` (watchdog.ts runs alongside), then stop;
// the summary (G11 movable ms/s, unlocked gate entries, lock hold/wait) goes in the row as `routelock`, the full report with
// per-second series to probe-out/queue/<queue>-<date>-<job>-routelock.json (docs/18 S1).
// age: age-save.ts on the loaded save, saved under a NEW name (save, default <job id>-<date>; never Baseline-*, never an existing
// save), checkpoints <name>-dayN; per checkpoint (and the loaded save first): folder MB, bytes per resource type (save-stats.ts),
// the ts3native.log "save: result" total ms, /memory, sim day -> row.checkpoints and probe-out/queue/<queue>-<date>-<job>-age.csv
// (age-report.ts prints the same summary as the md row).
// menuMemory.draws: n RandomGen.NextDouble() draws at the menu into the row (rngDraws), for the docs/27 Default.ini seed check.
// gameArgs go to TS3W.exe (ts3probe.py serve --launch -- <args>); defaultIni is merged into Bin/Default.ini for the job, then put back;
// s3ppIni the same for Bin/Sims3Performance.ini (S3PP switches, e.g. its Mono caches on/off); s3ssToml the same for
// <user>/S3SS/S3SS.toml ("<table>.<key>", e.g. patches.LotStreamingOptimizations.enabled; S3SS reads it at game start);
// dxvkConf the same for Bin/dxvk.conf (plain "key = value" lines, e.g. "d3d9.textureMemory": 64; DXVK reads it at start).
// profile.repro: profile-world.ts --repro <id> runs that repros.json entry's steps at the window start (no stack samplers).
// profile.untilCompares: N -> profile-world.ts --until-compares (end the window early once N shadow compares exist; 2N if N comes before 5 min; minutes is the cap).
// profile.repro with a `loop` (repro-loop.ts, docs/168 §6): profile.minutes is the cap; the window ends once the repro's fixed-count
// stop rule holds; row.stop and the verdict keep 'stopped at N events after M min (...)' (or 'loop cap reached: ..., rule not met').
// profile.frameLead: {service, ms?, min, lotAdds?} -> profile-world.ts --frame-lead (frame-lead.ts pass rule: frames > ms led by that main-slot service, docs/169).
// profile.fixesOff: "name,name" -> profile-world.ts --fixes-off (those switches off for the whole run).
// profile.fixesReport: "prefix,prefix": every ts3fixes `patches` key starting with one (numbers before/after, lists as read at the
// end, e.g. unseenfbpre_callers) goes into row.fixActivity and the `ts3fixes activity:` line; every fixesOn switch name is a prefix too.
// profile.fixesRequire: "name>=1,name<5000" -> profile-world.ts --fixes-require (ts3fixes counter rules checked at the end; FAIL verdict when one fails).
// profile.hitchTasks: ["<regex>[@ms]>=N" | "<regex>[@ms]<N"] -> profile-world.ts --hitch-tasks (hitch lines naming the expected script task, docs/169; FAIL verdict when one fails).
// profile.fixesOn: "name,name" -> profile-world.ts --fixes-on (those switches on for the whole run; e.g. autshadow, whose tuning is off).
// profile.ab: "name,name" -> profile-world.ts --ab (runtime switches alternate on/off in one load), profile.slice: minutes per side.
// profile.abOnFirst: true -> --ab-on-first (counted slices on,off,off,on instead of off,on,on,off).
// profile.mainstack: main | all | <thread id> -> profile-world.ts --mainstack (main-thread stacks beside the sim sampler, docs/20 §7).
// profile.taskstall: MS -> profile-world.ts --taskstall (stage stalls over MS ms with their managed stack; S3PP SimulatorStageProfiler must be off).
// profile.inroom: true -> profile-world.ts --inroom (tools/frida/inroom-reads.js, in-room routing live reads, docs/111; inroom-report.ts reads <tag>-inroom.json).
// profile.watchstalk: true -> profile-world.ts --watchstalk (tools/frida/watch-stalk.js instead of the stutter profiler, docs/113; watch-stalk-report.ts reads <tag>-watchstalk.json);
//   "worker" -> also --watchstalk-worker (the stalk phase follows the route worker's Route_PlanLocked, docs/113 §8; needs RouteAsync on).
// profile.livereads2: true -> profile-world.ts --livereads2 (tools/frida/live-reads2.js, routing live reads pass 2, docs/114; live-reads2-report.ts reads <tag>-livereads2.json).
// profile.f4b: true -> profile-world.ts --f4b (tools/frida/f4b-reads.js, F-4b live read, docs/99 §12.6; f4b-report.ts reads <tag>-f4b.json).
// profile.vres: true -> profile-world.ts --vres (docs/133: callvirt inline-cache snapshots through the probe agent's /vcache; virtual-resolution-report.ts reads <tag>-vres.json).
// profile.vresDry: N -> profile-world.ts --vres-dry N (the same snapshots, N methods each, no call following: docs/133 §5 bisect).
// profile.noSamplers: true -> profile-world.ts --no-samplers (no stack samplers; profile.noProf: true -> --no-prof (no stutter
// profiler session) also without [ProbeSnap]). Both make a bisect job match bp-vres apart from the one probe under test.
// profile.noFrames: true -> --no-frames (no frame-times.js session); profile.cameraPan: true -> --camera-pan (docs/162 §4).
// profile.loopRule: {until?, maxMinutes?} -> --loop-rule: a loop repro's stop rule for this job only (A/B queues: minFirings, docs/168 §7).
// profile.profOpts: {stages?: false, tasks?: false} -> --prof-opts (stutter-profile.js -P fields; docs/168 §4 profiler cost control).
// profile.noEnv: true -> profile-world.ts --no-env (no test_env guard: the repro sets winter, weather or a full moon itself, docs/117).
// profile.envGuard: false -> profile-world.ts --no-env-guard (test_env at the start only; seasons then pass as in play: story runs, docs/171 §16).
// profile.story: {seed?, stories?, censusOnly?, ...} -> profile-world.ts --story '<json>' (story fuzzer on a Story-* scratch copy, docs/171 §7).
// ini ProbeSnap.Enabled=1 -> profile-world.ts --no-prof (no second Frida agent beside the int3 sampler: docs/67 §7).
// Call-site coverage (docs/133 §7): every job that is not a timing job (timing = profile with noiseCheck not false) gets
// ini ProbeSnap.CallSites=1 (self-disarming int3 sites, ts3native >= 0.36.64; older builds ignore the key) unless it sets
// ProbeSnap.Enabled or ProbeSnap.CallSites itself or says callSites: false (job level; true forces it on a timing job);
// never on worldimage jobs, and never on a profile job that attaches a second Frida agent (stutter profiler unless noProf,
// or inroom / watchstalk / livereads2 / f4b): one attaching while int3 sites trap crashed the game (docs/67 §7). The auto key
// is then dropped with one queue log line; callSites: true or an ini ProbeSnap.CallSites != 0 on such a job is a parse error.
// After the job its ts3native.log copy is merged into probe-out/callsites/db.json (tools/callsite-db.ts; one line in the queue log).
// profile.travel: "university" | "future" | "france" | "china" | "egypt" -> profile-world.ts --travel (save-matrix.ts travel case with
//   --stay first, then the window and repro in that world, docs/117 §2.11); the job's timeoutMin must cover the trip (~30 min).
// profile.repros: [id | {id, minutes?, fixesRequire?, hitchTasks?, nativeRequire?, frameLead?}] (docs/170 §1): those repros back to
//   back in one game load, one profile-world.ts window each with its own tag <job tag>-<id> (own queue log <tag>.log, profiler
//   files, stop rule, arms, ts3native.log slice <tag>-HHMM-ts3native.log), so every report reads them as separate runs; item
//   fields override the job's profile fields; nativeRequire per item over that window's /native delta. Between two windows the
//   carry-over check of reuseSession runs (its limits, default REUSE_DEFAULTS) and reloads when it fails. row.repros[] per repro.
// reuseSession: true | {maxJobs, simDelta, membersDelta, lotObjectsDelta, vasMB, minLargestFreeMB, simHours, stuck, onFail} (job or
//   queue level, default off; session-reuse.ts, docs/170 §2): consecutive profile jobs with the same game start (asi + sha, ini,
//   fixes, save, content, gameArgs, defaultIni, s3ppIni, s3ssToml, dxvkConf, pin) share the running game; only runtime switches
//   (patches, native_set, --ab, fixesOn/Off) differ. After each window every switch goes back to its value after the load and a
//   world snapshot is compared with the one after the load; past a limit, after maxJobs windows, a stuck Sim or a failed cleanup
//   the next job gets a fresh start. A crash or failed window ends the session: onFail auto = TS3_NIGHT=1 (night-run.ts) goes
//   on with a fresh start, daytime stops the queue. row.session says 'fresh load' or 'reused session (#n since load)' and the
//   drift line; the hitch reports drop the first minute only after a load or reload (<tag>-session.json, worst-hitches.ts).
// Per job: cycle.ts --restart; copy the job's asi to Bin; write Bin/ts3native.ini = repo native/ts3native/ts3native.ini + job.ini
// (+ [CrashForensics] Light=1 unless the job sets it, runs a release asi or says releaseDefaults: true, docs/67 §18)
// (fresh each job, so settings never leak); install-fixes.ts changes; start `ts3probe.py serve --launch` as a child; cycle.ts --save
// (or wait for the menu); run; read /memory and /native before and after; close the game; undo the installer changes.
// content (default "as-is"): with the game closed, move the CC sets offload-phase0.ts switches (fixes.json user-cc and
// store-repacks-test include/exclude, applied to the live Mods folder; no-cc = both, no-store = the Store repacks only) to
// CONTENT_STASH outside Mods, manifest written first; moved back after the job; caches cleared after each move (install-fixes
// cache-clear). ts3agent/ts3fixes/ts3-nointro and files other fixes installed (install-fixes state.json) are never moved. The
// queue refuses to start while a manifest exists (--restore-content). cycle.ts --restart sees the Mods change, clears scriptCache.
// ccSet (docs/191, e.g. "game-copy/cc-synth/cc-1k"): a tools/cc-gen.ts set; its .package files MOVE (same volume: renames, never
// a second copy of a multi-GB set) into Mods/Packages/cc-synth before the load and back after the job, through the same
// manifest-first stashContent/restoreContent (direction reversed: the set dir is the source, the manifest sits in Mods/Packages/
// cc-synth), cache-clear both ways. An interrupted run: --restore-content moves them back; the queue refuses to start until then.
// ccSet may also be a list of sets (docs/200 §10): each set's files move to Mods/Packages/cc-synth/<set>/ under one manifest.
// ccLots (docs/200 §10, e.g. "game-copy/cc-synth/lots-cc"): tools/cc-lot-gen.ts ebf_*.package lots COPIED into Documents/Library
// (manifest first, next to the content stash) and deleted after the job; never overwrites a Library file; --restore-content removes them.
// Reuses the other harness tools as child processes (cycle.ts, repro.ts, save-matrix.ts, watchdog.ts, crash-ledger.ts, ai-usage.ts).
// Crash (TS3W.exe gone or "game died"): crash-ledger triage goes in the row, the queue goes on; it stops when the same job has
// crashed twice (today's rows of this queue count, so a resume remembers) or two jobs crash in a row.
// After each job: `ai-usage.ts G <job id>`; at >= 80% in either window the queue pauses and prints the --from line to resume.
// Output: probe-out/queue/<queue>-<date>.jsonl (one row per job, times UTC), docs/data/results/<date>-queue-<queue>.md (table, UTC + PHT).
// After each job the game's Bin/ts3native.log is copied to probe-out/queue/<queue>-<date>-<job>-<HHMM>-ts3native.log (row.nativeLog),
// and Bin/ts3native-shadow.jsonl (P4 shadow records) to ...-<HHMM>-shadow.jsonl (row.shadowLog) when the job wrote one.
// At the end the Bin ts3native.asi and ts3native.ini found at the start are put back as a pair (copies in probe-out/queue/bin-before/;
// until 2026-10-24 the asi came from native/ts3native/out/, which left an old build next to a job ini in Bin). The restored asi is
// named from docs/data/builds.json; a WARN line says when it is not a release build. Windows-only by nature (TS3W.exe, taskkill).
