# Changelog

Player-facing changes per release. Each `## vX.Y.Z` section becomes the GitHub release notes for that tag (`.github/workflows/build.yml`).

## v0.2.1 (2026-10-29)

Hotfix for players with **simler90's Gameplay Systems Core Mod**.

### Download

- `ts3fixes.package`: put it in `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods\Packages\` and replace the old one.
- `ts3native-v0.2.1.zip`: the same `ts3native.asi` and `ts3native.ini` as v0.2.0; you only need it if you don't have v0.2.0 yet.

### Fixed

- **simler90's nightly jobs run again.** simler90's core mod adds its own jobs to the game's 3 AM cleanup (aging up homeless pets and young townies, restoring missing household members, turning off noisy electronics, sending young Sims home). v0.2.0 split that cleanup into small steps but skipped simler90's jobs. v0.2.1 runs them again, inside the split-up cleanup. Tested with simler90 UPDATE242.
- Nothing changes for players without simler90.

## v0.2.0 (2026-10-28)

Routing release: fewer of the long "everyone stops" freezes when Sims plan their walks. Technical notes: [v0.2.0 developer notes](https://github.com/rodneypantonial/sims3-modernization/blob/v0.2.0/docs/release-notes/v0.2.0-dev.md).

### Download

- `ts3native-v0.2.0.zip`: put `ts3native.asi` and `ts3native.ini` in `The Sims 3\Game\Bin\` and replace the old ones. You still need an ASI loader, as before (see "How to install" below).
- `ts3fixes.package`: put it in `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods\Packages\` and replace the old one. Both files must come from this release.

### What's new

- **Time limits on route planning.** A Sim looking for a path that does not exist no longer holds up the whole game for seconds: plans that run too long end early with the game's own "can't get there" answer.
- **Hitch guard for Sims you can't see.** When an off-screen Sim's route goes wrong, the game no longer freezes waiting for it; the Sim gets a short cut or is moved along.
- **Nightly chores in small steps.** The game's 3 AM venue cleanup, the pet adoption pool and midnight relationship decay now run over many frames instead of one frozen frame. NRaas Overwatch's nightly stuck-Sim check is split up too.
- **Crash fix.** A rare crash where the game's script engine cleared more memory than it should.

### Results (our test saves, autopilot play, 10-15 minute loads)

Cells: no fixes -> v0.1.5 -> **v0.2.0**.

| | Bridgeport | Sunset Valley | Isla Paradiso |
|---|---|---|---|
| freezes of 300 ms or longer, per 10 minutes | 4.8 -> 5.0 -> **0.0** | 13.7 -> 4.3 -> **5.8** | 93.9 -> 20.0 -> **13.1** |
| sim iterations per second | 59.3 -> 56.9 -> n/a | 91.3 -> 73.2 -> **87.7** | 63.2 -> 65.8 -> **73.0** |
| p99 sim step | 79 -> 79 -> **84 ms** | 59 -> 67 -> **57 ms** | 168 -> 105 -> **107 ms** |

v0.2.0 numbers are the mean of several loads (Isla Paradiso 9, Sunset Valley 4, Bridgeport 1); v0.1.5 and no-fixes are one load each, so small differences are within noise. The Bridgeport v0.2.0 load ran with our profiler's samplers on, which slow the game, so its speed is left out.

### Good to know

- Your saves are not changed by installing or removing this release. As always, back up your saves first.
- Upgrading: replace both files; use the new `ts3native.ini` (the new features are switched on there).
- The guard's part for Build/Buy edge cases ships switched off and comes in v0.2.1.

## v0.1.6 (2026-10-25)

Hotfix: `ts3native.log` now tells us what we need to help you. No gameplay changes: same fixes, same settings as v0.1.5.

**You don't need to change any settings.** Install the two files below and play. Technical notes: [v0.1.6 developer notes](https://github.com/rodneypantonial/sims3-modernization/blob/v0.1.6/docs/release-notes/v0.1.6-dev.md).

### Download

- `ts3native-v0.1.6.zip`: put `ts3native.asi` and `ts3native.ini` in `The Sims 3\Game\Bin\` and replace the old ones. You still need an ASI loader, as before (see "How to install" below).
- `ts3fixes.package`: put it in `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods\Packages\` and replace the old one. Both files must come from this release.

### What's new

- **Better problem reports.** If something goes wrong (a save that never finishes, a freeze, a slowdown), close the game and send us `Game\Bin\ts3native.log` (GitHub issue or Discord) before you start the game again: every start writes a new one. The log now shows:
  - which version you run and how the game is installed, which other plugins sit next to the game (for example DXVK or other ASI mods), your graphics card, and how many mods and script mods you have (file names only);
  - how big your world is when it loads (lots, households, Sims, objects) and which of our settings are on;
  - for every save, each step of the save as it happens, what it waits for, and a line every 5 seconds while a save is still running. A save that gets stuck now shows where.
- **Privacy.** The log holds file names, never the folders they sit in, your Windows user name or your PC's name. Nothing is sent anywhere: you decide whether to send the file. Open it in Notepad to check before you send it.
- **Logging only.** It writes a few lines at start, when a world loads and when you save; nothing per frame. To switch it off, set `Enabled=0` under `[UserDiag]` in `ts3native.ini`.
- **Memory line (on).** Every 5 minutes of play the log gets one short line of memory numbers (`[MemDiag] Light=1`), so an Error 12 report already shows how the memory filled up. Logging only.
- **Error 12 report (test feature, off).** If you get Error 12 often, set `AllocSites=1` under `[MemDiag]` in `ts3native.ini`, play until it happens, and send us the log with `node report-crash.ts --memory` (it removes paths, names and emails and replaces your package file names with ids unless you add `--names`, shows you everything and asks first). It shows what filled the memory and whether our mod had a part in it. Its cost is still being measured: switch it off again after you sent the report. Off by itself when Apex Radiance is installed. See "Error 12 report" in the player notes.

### Good to know

- Your saves are not changed by installing or removing this release. As always, back up your saves first.
- Upgrading from v0.1.5: replace both files. The new `ts3native.ini` has the same settings as v0.1.5 plus the `[UserDiag]` section; a v0.1.5 `ts3native.ini` also works (the new log lines are then on by default).

### Tested

On the final build, because the new log lines sit on the save path: saving in many situations and reloading the saves in Bridgeport and Isla Paradiso (10 of 10 save tests passed; one earlier Isla Paradiso run failed its reload check on a game script error in a wedding clean-up that our mods do not touch, and the rerun passed); one save in an Isla Paradiso game 13 days in (passed); a trip to France and back with saves on the way (passed); saving twice, reloading and saving again with Apex Radiance v2.15.5 installed (passed, all saves finished in about 8 seconds); short play in Isla Paradiso (passed); the new log lines checked for content and privacy (passed). 8 of 9 test runs passed, no crashes.

Not tested: autosaves with NRaas Saver. Our test could not make Saver autosave during the run, so this case says nothing either way; the fix of the test is in progress. v0.1.6 changes nothing in how saving works, only what the log writes about it.

## v0.1.5 (2026-10-24)

Fewer freezes in the situations that caused the worst ones: Sims getting off boats, crowds, the game's 3 AM stuck-Sim check, NRaas Overwatch's nightly clean-up and NRaas ErrorTrap right after loading. Plus a crash fix. In everyday play it feels about the same as v0.1.4, which already had far fewer hitches than the unmodded game (in Isla Paradiso about 20 instead of about 94 freezes of a third of a second or longer per 10 minutes).

**You don't need to change any settings.** Install the two files below and play. The `ts3native.ini` file comes set up; its settings are for testers and developers only (technical notes: [v0.1.5 developer notes](https://github.com/rodneypantonial/sims3-modernization/blob/HEAD/docs/release-notes/v0.1.5-dev.md)).

### Download

- `ts3native-v0.1.5.zip`: put `ts3native.asi` and `ts3native.ini` in `The Sims 3\Game\Bin\` and replace the old ones. **Use the new `ts3native.ini`**: the old one keeps the new fixes off. You still need an ASI loader, as before (see "How to install" below).
- `ts3fixes.package`: put it in `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods\Packages\` and replace the old one. Both files must come from this release.

### What's better

- **No more 8-second freeze when Sims get off boats in Isla Paradiso.** When a Sim or an object moved while the game was planning a route in the background, the game sometimes stood still until the plan was done. In our boat test that was one freeze of 8.3 seconds; now there is none.
- **Fewer short freezes in crowds.** When many Sims look around them while a route is being planned, the game waits less.
- **The 3 AM stuck-Sim check no longer freezes the game.** Every night the game checks which Sims are stuck and plans new routes for them, all at once. That now happens one Sim at a time. In our test the worst freeze went from 1.2 seconds to under 0.15 seconds.
- **NRaas Overwatch: the nightly clean-up freeze is gone.** If you use Overwatch, its nightly clean-up now runs its jobs one after another instead of all in the same moment. In our test the worst freeze went from 0.3 seconds to 0.1 seconds.
- **NRaas ErrorTrap: no hitch right after loading a save.** If you use ErrorTrap, the check it runs a moment after every load is spread out (worst freeze 0.28 seconds down to 0.06 in our test).

### Fixed

- **A rare crash near water.** With background route planning on, the game could crash when it looked for a spot on the shore (for example a Sim getting off a boat in Isla Paradiso) at the same moment a route was being planned. Fixed and checked in two long test runs without a crash.

### Good to know

- The game does slightly fewer simulation steps per second than without mods, the same as v0.1.4. You won't see this: the clock runs at the speed you pick, and what you see is fewer and shorter hitches.
- Your saves are not changed by installing or removing this release. As always, back up your saves first.

### Tested

On the final build: play in Bridgeport, Isla Paradiso and Sunset Valley; saving in many situations and reloading the saves; a trip to France and back; each new fix forced on in its test scenario; all fixes off versus on in the same scenarios; water and boat scenarios; and two 45-minute play sessions. 27 of 27 tests passed, no crashes.

Still to do: in Sunset Valley the game can still freeze for a second or more now and then (in our 45-minute test: 4 times, the longest 3.6 seconds). v0.1.4 does the same; it comes from route plans the game still makes on its main loop for one Sim on behalf of another. That is the main target of the next release.

## v0.1.4 (2026-10-20)

Background route planning: Sims plan their walks and drives on a second CPU core while the game keeps running.

### Download

- `ts3native-v0.1.4.zip`: put `ts3native.asi` and `ts3native.ini` in `The Sims 3\Game\Bin\` (replace the v0.1.3 files; **use the new `ts3native.ini`**, the old one keeps background routing off). Needs an ASI loader, as before. Built as ts3native 0.36.0.
- `ts3fixes.package`: put it in `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods\Packages\` (replace the v0.1.3 file). Background routing needs this package: it is what hands a Sim's route plan to `ts3native`. Its settings are the same as v0.1.3 (no default changed).

### New in `ts3native` (on by default)

- **Route planning in the background (`[RouteAsync]`, with `[RouteGate]` `Sites=1` `Enforce=1` and `[Discourage]`).** When a Sim plans a route from its own task, the game's own planner now runs on a worker thread while the simulation goes on; the Sim waits tick by tick for its answer. Routing locks keep the main thread off the routing data while a plan runs (`[RouteGate]`), and discourage-area changes made during a plan are applied in order right after it (`[Discourage]`, design D with the D-X destroy and dead-object fixes). Measured on Bridgeport, same build, seeded 10-minute runs, async on vs off: simulation time spent on routing **119 -> 50 ms/s**, **+10-12% simulation iterations/s**, **-17% hitches**; the worst hitches (p99) unchanged within noise (PLAN.md "Async routing (H6) state"; runs: `docs/data/results/2026-10-16-queue-h6-m1.md`, `docs/data/results/2026-10-17-queue-h6-m1.md`; realistic test environment env-off/env-on pairs for Bridgeport and Isla Paradiso: `docs/data/results/2026-10-17-queue-clean-night.md`, build 50bb1d4, jobs `bp-env-off`, `bp-env-on`, `ip-env-on`, `ip-env-off`, all PASS). Replans (`[RouteAsync] Kinds`) stay on the main thread. To turn it off: `[RouteAsync] Enabled=0`.
- **Already on since earlier builds, now listed:** `[LotRemoveGuard]` (flushes a lot's deferred footprint removals before the game walks them; prevents a crash at `0x63576A`) and `[OptsInit]` (the route planner's search options start at 0 instead of stale stack values; fixes an uninitialised read in the game).

### Shipped but off (switches for testers)

- **Routing snapshot (`[RouteSnap]`, P3/P4 copy, P5 / P5b / P5c answers).** The code is in the build; `ts3native.ini` keeps `Enabled=0`, `Mode=0`, `Lots=none`. It is not part of the measured gains above and has not passed the release checks; turn it on only to help test, with backups.
- Every other experimental section stays off as in v0.1.3 and the list below: `[ThreadStack]`, `[AutShadow]`, `[MonoThread]`, `[WorldImage]`, `[SteerRO]`, `[SlotEnabledRO]`, `[LotFrontDoorRO]`, `[ObstructedRO]`, `[RouteCache]`, `[RouteWorker]`, `[RouteBudget]`, `[Alloc]` and the rest.

### Tests (release validation, `tools/harness/queues/release-validate.json`)

Results: `docs/data/results/2026-10-20-queue-release-validate.md`. All jobs on the release build (sha256 in `docs/RELEASE.md`) with the release `ts3native.ini`, no per-job overrides; the save matrix runs the fixes as shipped (`--fixes shipped`).

| Group | Jobs | Cases | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Play, crash-free (12 min seeded) | 3 | Bridgeport, Isla Paradiso, Sunset Valley | 3/3 PASS (BP 16,608 background plans, 0 watchdogs, 0 stuck Sims) |
| Saves | 3 | Bridgeport, Sunset Valley, Isla Paradiso: 15 saves each with background routing on | 45/45 saves written (result 0); 3/3 reloads PASS (one save per world made unpaused with background routing on, loaded and played 3 min: `docs/data/results/2026-10-20-queue-release-reload.md`). No save code changed since v0.1.3, so the full save matrix was not rerun |
| Travel round trips + travel save | 6 | France, China, Egypt, University, Future (queued and direct start) | 4/6 PASS; Future: both trips arrived without a crash, the harness could not queue the trip home (known harness gap, not a game fault) |
| Rare routing scenarios (docs/117) | 21 | winter pond, thunderstorm, full moon werewolf, route bits, ghost walk, occult walks, death walk, big crowd, IP water, world walk (University, France), owned vehicles, stroller, horse ride, zombies, broom flight | 20/21 PASS, 0 crashes; stroller: the harness could not create a stroller object (setup step, not a game fault) |

33 jobs run: 27 PASS, 0 crashes. Failures are harness-side only (Future trip home x2, stroller setup) plus the 3 earlier save-matrix jobs that could not switch experimental save fixes (replaced by the saves row).

### Recommended setting (optional)

- **NRaas Overwatch: turn off "Clean up Inventory".** Once per game day Overwatch's nightly cleanup looks up the name of every inventory item and the game freezes for about half a second (docs/96). In game: City Hall > NRaas > Overwatch > Settings > Clean up Inventory = off. For new saves the installer entry `overwatch-no-invcleanup` sets it. Trade-off: broken or orphaned inventory items are no longer removed. Not yet measured; see queue job `bp-overwatch-cleanup-ab`.

### New in `ts3fixes` (experimental, off by default)

- **SafeSpot placement reuse (`kSafeSpotReuse`, switch `safespotreuse`).** A townie placed by a trip shortcut at a spot already verified on that lot no longer runs another native placement search (`FindGoodLocation`, up to five per child at the Isla Paradiso school run); it gets the spot and facing stored from the first search while the spot's cached routability verdict holds. Experimental: off in the tuning; not tested in a live game yet and no gain is claimed (queue job `ip-safespot-ab`).
- **Spring wildflowers without the hitch (`kWildflowerTask`, switch `wildflowertask`).** With Seasons, each spring the game grows wildflowers on up to ~32 lots, one lot per sim hour, and tries up to 20 spots per lot inside one alarm call: 0.3-1 s freezes (docs/110). With this on the tries run one per sim tick in their own task: same lots, flowers, try limit and outcome; a flower may appear a fraction of a second later. A save while a try is pending drops that one flower. A measure mode (`wildflowerprobe`) logs tries and times per fire without changing anything. Experimental: off in the tuning; not tested in a live game yet and no gain is claimed (queue `wildflower.json`).
- **Door lock table for background routing (`kDoorMirror`, switch `doormirror`).** Groundwork for answering door locks without asking the game's scripts during a route search (docs/105 §10.5): ts3fixes keeps a per-lot table of every door's lock settings and marks a lot out of date when a door's lock is imported (placing a lot from the library or bin). At each route plan, the start and goal lots' tables are sent to ts3native's routing snapshot when its copy is out of date. ts3native does not use them in route searches yet, so this changes nothing in play. Off by default.

### New in `ts3native` (experimental, off by default)

- **Routing snapshot shadow, part A (`[RouteSnap] Mode=1`, test builds only).** Step P4 of the planned routing snapshot (docs/94 §18): after a background route job finishes, the route thread can plan the same request again on a private copy of the routing data and compare the two answers; the game's own answer is always the one used. Since 0.29.0 the copy is the routing snapshot lot copy below (`Lots=replay`), brought to the moment each background plan starts (docs/94 §21); since the private pools build below the copy no longer shares the game's memory pools. Off in `ts3native.ini` (`Mode=0`).
- **Private memory pools for the routing snapshot (`[RouteSnap] Lots=replay`, test builds only).** The game's routing quadtree and map memory pools have no lock, and many game paths use them outside the routing lock (docs/94 §16.6). The routing snapshot lot copy and the shadow plans on it now take their quadtree, map, A\*, goal and cell nodes from pools of their own, so they can no longer corrupt the game's pools or keep using memory the game frees when it resets its route planner (docs/94 §16.7). The same build fixes the order of lots in the copy's lot table after a lot is re-copied. Earlier `Lots=replay` and `Mode=1` test builds should not be run any more. Since 0.31.5 a shadow plan that frees a node of the game's pools, or a thread that frees a node of the copy's A\* pools without owning it, leaks that node instead of returning it to a pool another thread uses at the same moment (docs/67 §8). Off in `ts3native.ini`.
- **Background route plans that check line of sight stay on the main simulation thread (`[RouteAsync]`).** Plans that ask for physics-based line of sight change which floor of a lot is shown while they run; with background routing on, that could leave the wrong floor showing after a floor change. Those plans are no longer moved to the background (docs/94 §17.9).
- **Routing snapshot lot copy (`[RouteSnap] Lots=replay`, test builds only).** 0.29.0: no longer fails on one kind of object footprint (the copy used to be rebuilt and fail every quarter second), leaves a lot out instead of giving up when it meets an unknown footprint kind, and copies the snapshot's terrain cost maps in larger pieces again (cheaper). Step P3-B of the planned routing snapshot (docs/94 §16): keeps a private copy of every lot's routing footprints and quadtrees up to date by replaying the game's own changes in order on a background thread, and checks it against the game's data; optional `Prebuild=1` builds every lot's routing graph on the loading screen. Nothing reads the copy yet and it is off in `ts3native.ini`. The same build fixes three findings of the world-image test: the tuning value set by the game during play, a full key table that made Isla Paradiso's cost-map updates expensive, and smaller cost-map tiles.
- **Routing snapshot world images (`[RouteSnap] Enabled`, test builds only).** Step P3 of the planned routing snapshot (docs/94 §14): keeps an up-to-date copy of the game's world-level routing data (waypoint graph, water and cost grids, footprint grid, terrain mask, tuning) and checks it against the game's own data. Nothing reads the copy yet, so play does not change. Off in `ts3native.ini` (`Enabled=0`).
- **Routing change counters (`[RouteSnap] Count`, test builds only).** A measurement switch for the planned routing snapshot (docs/94 phase P1): it counts every write to the game's routing data and what caused it, and changes nothing in play. Off in `ts3native.ini` (`Count=0`); only test runs turn it on. The same switch now also names the remaining causes (furniture placement, platforms, trees, terrain lookups, deferred updates) and measures how many changes per second the planned snapshot would have to copy and what that would cost (docs/94 §15).
- **Read-only steering (`[SteerRO]`).** While a background route job holds the routing lock, walking Sims can check their steering against a read-only copy instead of waiting for the job. Experimental: switched off in `ts3native.ini` (`Enabled=0`); no speed gain is claimed yet, and the first live test was correct but slower.
- **Background replans (`[RouteAsync] Kinds`).** Sims' route replans (Replan, PlanFromPoint, ReplanFromPoint) can be planned on the background route thread like their first plans, while the game keeps running. Experimental: switched off in `ts3native.ini` (`Kinds=0`), needs the matching ts3fixes; not tested in a live game yet and no gain is claimed.
- **Read-only lot front door (`[LotFrontDoorRO]`).** The lookup of a lot's front door can be answered without waiting for a background route job. Experimental: switched off in `ts3native.ini` (`Enabled=0`); not tested in a live game yet and no gain is claimed.
- **Read-only "is a Sim standing here" check (`[ObstructedRO]`).** After a route, the check for Sims standing on the goal can be answered without waiting for a background route job. Experimental: switched off in `ts3native.ini` (`Enabled=0`); not tested in a live game yet and no gain is claimed.
- **Read-only slot position (`[SlotEnabledRO]`).** When a Sim asks for a routing slot's position while a background route job runs, the lookup runs under a shared lock instead of waiting for the job. Experimental: switched off in `ts3native.ini` (`Enabled=0`); not tested in a live game yet and no gain is claimed.

## v0.1.3 (2026-10-16)

Hotfix: the v0.1.2 speed-ups were shipped switched off.

### Download

- `ts3fixes.package`: put it in `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods\Packages\` (replace the v0.1.2 file). **Please update if you installed v0.1.2.**
- `ts3native-v0.1.3.zip`: same as v0.1.2 (no changes); keep your v0.1.2 files or replace them.

### Fixed

- **Faster saving and the lighter Sim panel are now really on.** In v0.1.2 the package's settings file still listed these four fixes as off, and the game uses that file over the built-in defaults, so the v0.1.2 package ran with them off. v0.1.3 ships the settings file with `kFastRefTable`, `kMotiveBarImageCache`, `kBuffGridInPlace` and `kSimNameCache` on. Nothing else changed; the tests listed under v0.1.2 apply.

## v0.1.2 (2026-10-16)

Faster saves and a lighter Sim panel.

### Download

- `ts3fixes.package`: put it in `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods\Packages\` (replace the v0.1.1 file).
- `ts3native-v0.1.2.zip`: put `ts3native.asi` and `ts3native.ini` in `The Sims 3\Game\Bin\` (replace the v0.1.1 files). Needs an ASI loader, as before. The new native save options below are off unless you switch them on in `ts3native.ini`.

### New in `ts3fixes.package` (on by default)

- **Lighter Sim panel.** The needs bars, the moodlet grid and Sim names in the panel no longer rebuild from scratch every time a need changes: the bars keep their pictures while the moodlet is the same, the moodlet grid updates its cells in place, and names come from a small cache. Only the panel changes; nothing in the game itself or in your save. Tested in one load per town with the fixes switching on and off every 3 minutes: Bridgeport PASS (30.2 vs 27.5 game updates per second and 4.1 vs 5.1 hitches per second with the fixes on vs off; one run, so treat it as a hint, not a measurement). Isla Paradiso PASS (44.0 vs 43.0 updates per second, 2.5 hitches per second either way).
- **Faster saving.** The game keeps a list of every object it has already written into the save, and in big towns that list got slow past about 16,000 objects. It now stays fast. The save file comes out the same (script data byte-identical with the fix on or off). Saves: Bridgeport 12.7 -> 10.3 s (-19%); Sunset Valley -17% to -24% over 3 paired saves (11.5 -> 8.7 s, 11.3 -> 9.3 s, 10.7 -> 8.8 s); Isla Paradiso -14% and -23% over 2 pairs (11.8 -> 10.1 s, 12.8 -> 9.8 s). One Isla Paradiso all-off vs all-on pair came out equal (11.0 vs 11.1 s): single saves there vary by up to 2 s, so treat the per-world numbers as ranges. It passed every save test below.

### New in `ts3native` (off, opt-in)

- **Faster lot footprint lookup when saving (`[FootprintIndex]`, off).** Saving a lot no longer scans every footprint in the town to find its owner. Same save result (checked with the built-in verify: 330 levels, 82 lots, 0 fallbacks). Reason for off: the gain (about 0.4 s, estimated) does not show above normal save-to-save variation, so it is not worth a new default yet.
- **Save writes to disk later (`[SaveFlush]`, needs `[SaveWrite]`, off).** The game waits less for the disk at the end of a save. Fixed during testing: a flush could fail on `Meta.data` when another program held the file for a moment (error 32); it now retries. Reason for off: no gain on an NVMe SSD; it should help slow or spinning disks (not measured), so it is for players who want to try it.
- **`[SaveCompress]` (stays off).** Measurement only: it reports compression time per save (0.85-0.9 s in Bridgeport) and changes nothing. Compressing in parallel is not possible without changing the save layout.

All four on together: Bridgeport save 13.1 -> 10.1 s (-23%).

### Save tests

Each world: one paused load, the fixes switched at runtime, every save compared resource by resource with the fixes off (`tools/harness/save-matrix.ts`). Cases: control, identical (all off vs all on), per-fix, overwrite, back-to-back, unpaused, build mode, verify counters, reload.

| World / case | Date | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Bridgeport, 9 cases | 2026-10-14 | 8/9 PASS (build mode: the game refuses to save there, so nothing to compare; reload: off and on saves both load with 0 script errors). Verify counters failed on a wrong check in the test tool, fixed since and passed in the worlds below |
| Sunset Valley, 9 cases | 2026-10-15 | 9/9 PASS (after the `Meta.data` retry fix; the run before it had 1 flush fail per save) |
| Isla Paradiso, 9 cases | 2026-10-15 | 9/9 PASS (one per-fix run failed because the town changed between saves while paused, with the off save differing too; rerun PASS) |
| Vacation travel (Isla Paradiso -> France -> home) | 2026-10-15 | PASS |
| University and future travel | 2026-10-16 | **Open.** Our test tool could not start these trips yet (the Sim dropped the queued trip before leaving), so no save ran; the save code was never reached. Vacation travel uses the same travel save and passed. A direct-trip test is in progress for v0.1.3. |

28 cases run: 27 PASS, 1 test-tool fail (fixed). University and future travel open (see above).

## v0.1.1 (2026-10-14)

Two more `ts3native` fixes switched on after in-game testing. `ts3fixes.package` is unchanged from v0.1.0.

### Download

- `ts3native-v0.1.1.zip`: put `ts3native.asi` and `ts3native.ini` in `The Sims 3\Game\Bin\` (replace the v0.1.0 files). Needs an ASI loader, as before.
- `ts3fixes.package`: same as v0.1.0; keep yours or replace it.

### New in `ts3native` (on by default)

- **Faster unpacking of game files.** The game unpacks compressed textures, objects and other data all the time while loading and playing. A faster unpacker gives exactly the same results (checked against the game's own unpacker on every file of a full Bridgeport load: 0 differences; about 144,000 files unpacked over 4 test sessions without a problem). The gain is small: less work on load screens and when new items stream in.
- **Saving freezes the game a little less.** When you save over an existing save, the game first makes a backup copy of the old one. That copy now happens in the background while the game writes the new save, instead of the game stopping to do it. Saves and backups come out the same and load normally.

### Tested in game, no change needed

- The swimming and houseboat leftover fix from v0.1.0: confirmed working (with the fix, leftover route data is cleaned up; without it, it piles up).
- The smoother NRaas Overwatch nightly check from v0.1.0: confirmed working.

### Still being tested (off, not part of this release)

Faster Create-a-Sim hair lists, a faster memory allocator, a route cache and a few smaller caches. They did not show a clear win yet, so they stay off.

### Where these fixes come from

Same as v0.1.0: all code in this release is our own, nothing copied from other mods, no EA files. S3SS also speeds up the same unpacking step with its own decoder; ours is separate code and leaves S3SS's patch in place.

## v0.1.0 (2026-10-14)

First release: our two fixes for The Sims 3 (Steam 1.67, all expansions). Less stutter, more game time per real second, fewer stuck Sims.

### Download

- `ts3fixes.package`: the script mod with the stutter fixes. Put it in `Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods\Packages\` (needs the usual `Mods\Resource.cfg`; script mods enabled in the game options).
- `ts3native-v0.1.0.zip`: the native plugin. Put `ts3native.asi` and `ts3native.ini` in `The Sims 3\Game\Bin\`. Needs an ASI loader (for example Ultimate ASI Loader as `wininet.dll`).

Close the game before installing. To undo, delete the files again.

### What you will notice

Measured over 10 minutes at speed 3 on the same saves, with and without `ts3fixes`:

| World | Game time per real second | Stutters (frames of 50 ms or more) |
|---|---|---|
| Bridgeport | +61% | -39% |
| Sunset Valley | +85% | -47% |
| Isla Paradiso | +133% | -51% |

### Fixes in `ts3fixes.package` (on by default)

- **Townies you can't see skip the walk.** A townie going home, to work, to school, to a shop or to a park, far from the camera and from your Sims, arrives without walking or driving the whole way. The game still runs the last few steps and the arrival, so what the Sim does next is unchanged. Your household and anyone you can see always walk.
- **No pointless route retries.** An unseen townie whose route failed waits 30 sim-minutes before trying the same trip again, skips the route-fail animation nobody sees, and keeps its planned route instead of re-rolling for a subway or hover train detour.
- **Homeless townies leave quietly.** Unseen townies leaving town fade out straight away instead of first walking to a random lot.
- **Stuck Sims get unstuck.** A Sim frozen in place, blocked in a doorway, trapped on a spot it can't walk off, in a hidden room, or failing its routes over and over gets the game's own reset or is sent home. At most once or twice per Sim per day.
- **Smoother nights with NRaas Overwatch.** Overwatch's nightly stuck check is spread over several moments instead of one ~300 ms freeze.
- **No more leftovers from swimming and houseboats.** A Sim swimming out to sea or boarding a houseboat no longer leaves dead route data behind, which piled up in Isla Paradiso saves.
- **Cheaper background work.** Music, fires and smells far from the camera check for nearby Sims less often, and walk styles are looked up faster.

This release contains only these stable fixes. Features still in testing stay switched off.

### Fixes in `ts3native` (on by default)

- **Fewer memory clean-up pauses.** The game's script memory starts bigger and grows in larger steps, so it pauses to clean up far less often (128 forced clean-ups down to 1 in 6 minutes in Bridgeport).
- **Faster boat and swimming routes.** Route searches over water use a faster version of the game's own search: about 4x faster in an offline test, with exactly the same results (5.4 million in-game searches in Isla Paradiso compared with the game's own code: 0 differences).

Only these two are switched on in the shipped `ts3native.ini`; everything else in it stays off until it is verified in game.

### Where these fixes come from

- **All code in this release is our own.** It was written from scratch in this repo. No code from another mod was copied, ported or repackaged, and no EA game files or decompiled EA code are included.
- **Other mods are not part of this release.** Community fixes (DXVK, Sims 3 Settings Setter, NRaas, the Smooth Patch, and others) stay with their authors: get them from their own pages. The repo's installer sets them up only so developers and testers get the same test setup we measure with. `docs/01-existing-fixes-comparison.md` lists them with credits.
- **New, as far as we know:** the unseen-townie shortcuts, route retry backoff, the houseboat and swimming leak fix, the background-work throttles, and the water route speed-up. We know of no other mod that does these.
- **Our own version of a known idea:** the stuck-Sim checks do a job NRaas Overwatch's Stuck Check also does (we studied what it does and wrote our own code), and the memory setting builds on a known Boehm GC heap tweak. These are credited, not claimed as new.
