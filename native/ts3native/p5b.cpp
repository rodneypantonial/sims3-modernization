// [RouteSnap] ReleaseLock=1: P5b (docs/94 §22.9; counters v62). Included by ts3native.cpp after p5.cpp. Needs Mode=2.
// P5 runs its clone run inside the A10 job, and the job holds the live routing lock +0x918 for the whole IC call, so the sim
// still waits for the clone run as it waited for the game's own search. The clone run reads only the clone (T1-T4, the copy's
// world; a live +0x918 acquire from it is the livelock tripwire), so P5b lends +0x918 out while it runs:
//   - open (worker, P5Plan after the acquire, before P4RunClone; taken jobs only, verify jobs keep the hold): publish
//     g_p5bWin, wait until no disallowed acquire is inside the game's Lock_Acquire (P5bLock counts them: a try ends at once,
//     a blocking wait in there would get the lock the moment we let go, so it refuses the window), then release the worker's
//     whole recursion count with the game's Lock_Release;
//   - while open, only the sim's steering takers get the lock: RT_STEER frames (0x82EDB0 / 0x82F0B0, rtsites.cpp, t_steerRet
//     set) outside a gate wait and outside a job callback, plus recursive acquires of the holder. Every other acquire sees the
//     lock as the worker's, as today: a try fails, a wait goes on until the window is closed (and then for the job). Steering
//     is the docs/81-83 per-tick taker pair; under +0x918 it makes no managed call, remote call, world event or destroy and
//     waits for no job (docs/83 §1 closure, 5 hops [verified there]), so it always gives the lock back;
//   - g_async.state stays A_RUNNING: destroys, saves, BuildRoutingData, lot saves, closing, D drains, collects and sync plans
//     wait for the job as before (RtWaitJob, WaitAsyncDone, the gate waits), so nothing the suspended IC frame holds is
//     destroyed or freed meanwhile, and H2 / job starts are unchanged (no job starts while this one runs);
//   - retake (worker) before anything live: after the clone run (P5Plan, before the answer is moved or the game's plan runs),
//     before a door ask (its managed call goes to the sim, whose callbacks borrow the job's hold; reopened after the ask), and
//     at any tripwire (P4Abort: managed call, world event, live +0x918 acquire, lazy stop; not reopened). The retake tries in a
//     loop (the steering holder ends its call) and logs every 2 s with the owner thread.
// 0.34.2 ([RouteSnap] ReleaseGates=1, switch p5bGates; docs/94 §22.10): read-only gate leaves are admitted too, on the sim
// (the jobs' owner) outside a job callback, during a gate's +0x918 wait (RgEnter sets t_p5bSite / t_p5bSlot):
//   - gate 12 LotTable_Contains (reads only the table) for the read families: F-C front door (key 0x631814) and F-B slot
//     position (key 0x62F782 with second frame 0x76F15D). Not F-G placement (0x631F40; docs/155: its unlocked tail after the
//     leaf can flush the quadtree, waits as before, counted in p5bFgHeldOut). Not the rest of 0x62F782 / 0x62FB74: F-A
//     footprint level rebuild, F-D portal writer ICs (they write the live portal objects the clone holds), F-E, F-F;
//   - gate 0 LotTable_GetOrInsert on a hit (checked with LtFind once the lent lock is ours, so nothing else moves the table):
//     a hit writes nothing; a miss would insert, so the lock is given back and the entry waits as before.
// Their callers' portal counts are interlocked while P4 is armed (H20a). Writers (gate 10 and the coarse gates, the footprint
// writers 0x833593 / 0x8334CC / 0x82D296 / 0x82A0F6, discourage) still wait; destroys still wait (RtWaitJob; design G).
