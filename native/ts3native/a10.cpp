// [RouteAsync] Kinds (design A10, docs/87 §5): the Replan-family route ICs as async jobs, like Route.Plan. Included by
// ts3native.cpp after p10.cpp. Off by default (Kinds=0: nothing hooked, today's behaviour).
//
// The three ICs [verified disassembly, Steam 1.67; docs/87 §2]: IC_Route_Replan 0x765490 cdecl(result*, handle) like
// IC_Route_Plan (plus `add [route+0x1F4],1` before its start-point builder 0x7641D0); IC_Route_PlanFromPoint 0x765240 and
// IC_Route_ReplanFromPosition 0x765550 cdecl(result*, handle, x, y, z): the point is three floats by value, so the job
// keeps its own copy and no argument points into managed memory. Each wraps its work in the route's vtable +0x10/+0x14
// AddRef/Release and copies a 0x48-byte RoutePlanResult to result*. Their direct-call closure to Route_PlanCommon (5 hops)
// is a subset of the IC_Route_Plan job's (9 hops), except Route_StartPointsBuild 0x7642C0 and its lot helper 0x74BE50
// (World_LotLookup, 0xB01390, 0xADD800: lot reads the goal step makes in every Plan job) [verified closure]; no managed
// entry before Route_PlanLocked [verified]. So a job runs the whole original IC on the worker, exactly as a Plan job.
//
// Handshake (ts3fixes RouteBackoff.cs ReplanHook / PlanFromPointHook / ReplanFromPointHook): POINT x 3 (kinds 2-3), START
// of the kind (GetOptionHook in ts3native.cpp), READY / CANCEL as for Route.Plan; the C# side then calls the original
// method, whose internal call lands here and takes the stored result (IcCollect: same route, same kind, same point).
// Every rule of the Plan path is the shared code: yield check, M1 refusals, queue, D drains at START, gate waits, H2,
// G10-C, D-X destroy waits, a stale job dropped by the next START of its route or by its own IC.
// New refusal: the route is being followed (Route_IsActive), arActive.
// Mode (arMode, --ab asyncreplan): 0 = shadow, every check runs and START is refused (arShadow), 1 = async.
