// [AutShadow] part 1 (docs/122 §2, §3, §12.5 F2; gate G-A1, docs/122 §13): IC guard thunks, the snapshot builder and its
// change tracking, and the F2 abort at String.ParseFormatSpecifier. Part 2 (autshadow-run.cpp, docs/122 §14): the cut
// at [MonoThread]'s Simulate slot, the reference run and worker dispatch, the AutShadowNative ICs for ts3fixes
// AutShadow, the rooted column for managed answers (AsTab::refs) and the managed-array allocator (AsNewArrayGc).
// Included by ts3native.cpp after routesnap.cpp: routesnap's World_FireEvent detour and its two build/buy IC slots call
// AsWorldEvent / AsEpochBump (one more consumer, routing behaviour unchanged), and our object-event nodes go in through
// routesnap's g_snObjReg at world event 7, like routesnap's own.
//
// Guards (docs/122 §3.1): every {fn, name} pair of the exe's IC provider tables gets a 10-byte thunk `push index; jmp entry`
// written into the table before MonoScriptHost_Init (DllMain time). Any thread but the worker: the thunk tail-jumps to
// what the slot held (the game body, or routesnap's slot stub in front of it: the thunk sits in front, routesnap keeps
// its slot). The worker: the snapshot answer, a stub, or an abort with the neutral value for the IC's return kind
// (autshadow-kinds.h: fldz for float/double, the hidden result pointer for structs, else 0 in edx:eax). Session-memo
// ICs (docs/122 §2.2) go through the slow entry on every thread: the sim thread's own call is recorded (key -> answer).
//
// Snapshot (docs/122 §2): one generic answer table. An entry is (IC, input argument dwords) -> the answer the game's own
// body gave at the cut (return value, struct bytes, out parameters, array contents), so worker answers are bit-equal by
// construction. Object rows = the entries owned by an object id (the request's rows from AsAddRow plus learned keys);
// lot table, door room pairs and geometry = entries owned by the world (rebuilt on the epoch); per-lot lists = entries
// keyed (type, lot, flags) with the list generation; constants = zero-argument entries; the memo = entries recorded on
// the sim thread's pass-through. Master table on the sim thread, two published versions (A/B) for the worker.
