# Night / chained runs

```
node tools/harness/night-run.ts                                   # report only: lock/idle state, apps, resume plan
node tools/harness/night-run.ts --queue-list a.json,b.json --close [--stop-on-fail]
node tools/harness/night-run.ts --queue-list a.json,b.json --resume  # continue from the first job without a row
```

Rules: timing queues only when the machine is quiet (Rodney says when he uses it); Spotify is stopped only on night runs (`TS3_NIGHT=1`, set by night-run.ts) or with `queue.ts --close-spotify`, daytime runs leave his apps alone; other apps close only with `--close` on Rodney's go (needs lock or idle). Correctness tests may run in the daytime when they unblock work. Check progress with the ts3-status skill.

Main session: run this and decide only; hand log reads, triage and fixes to a sub-agent (AGENTS.md, "Main agent orchestrates").
