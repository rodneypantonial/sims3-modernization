# 126. Autonomy allow-list tier 2: the rest of meta and the local phase

The next step after allow-list v0 (docs/122 §12.3: 12 meta definitions + 7 implementors). Takes the definitions after the pilot by sampled scoring share (docs/75, `docs/data/autonomy-entry-list.csv`), runs the `managed-callgraph.ts` closure for each, classifies every IC the pilot snapshot does not already answer by the docs/121 scheme (a snapshot or cache, a-stub, b sim thread, c safe, d unclear; plus **w** = the IC writes engine or sim state), and lists which definitions are ready with the existing snapshot, which need new snapshot rows and which are blocked. Static only: call-graph index and assemblies of the Steam 1.67 install, the decompiled class library for the hook sites. No game run, no build. Per-candidate table: `docs/data/autonomy-tier2.csv`; generator `tools/autonomy-tier2.ts`.

Tags: **[verified]** = tool output or read in the decompiled class library for this note; **[inferred]** = from names, the docs/62 scan or sample shares, not read to the end.

## Summary

| | Samples | Share of scoring |
|---|---|---|
| Pilot (allow-list v0 + the meta part of the shared base path) | 640 | 62.0% |
| **Tier 2 (everything else)** | **393** | **38.0%** |
| Tier 2 newly covered, ready with the 4 tier-2 hooks (§3), no new row | 164 attributed + ~111 shared base path | **~27%** [inferred] |
| Tier 2 newly covered, plus the new rows of §4 | 189 attributed + ~128 shared base path | **~31%** [inferred] |
| Left: blocked definitions, unresolved local buckets, unmapped base frames | ~76 | ~7% |

Of 1,033 scoring samples (docs/75 §2). "Attributed" = samples in a row whose types have a verdict (row 5's bucket split by its candidates' verdict counts); "shared base path" = the 142 non-meta samples of `CheckAvailability`, `CommonTests`, C2 self and `get_Parent`, which follow the local pairs and are split here in the same ratio as the attributed local time (0.78 ready, 0.90 with new rows) [inferred: pairs per type are still not measured, docs/75 §6].

**Candidates: 251** (37 meta, 31 sampled local, 169 candidates of the biggest unresolved bucket, 11 local base paths, 3 scoring functions) [verified: tool output]:

| Verdict | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **ready** | **172** | no IC outside the pilot snapshot set, no new managed write (after the hooks and pre-warm list of §3) |
| **new rows** | **61** | needs 1-6 more class-a IC answers; 26 distinct ICs in all (§4) |
| **blocked** | **16** | sim-thread or writing IC, own-field write, or a real static write (§5) |
| hooked | 2 | the base-path row is itself a tier-2 hook site (§3) |

- **All 37 remaining meta definitions are ready** (every one of the 49 concrete `MetaInteractionDefinition` subclasses is now in v0 or tier 2), including `VisitCommunityLotWith+VisitWithDefinition` once docs/122's H6 exists. That closes rows 14, 37, 40, 52 and 66 of docs/75 and the meta parts of rows 17, 19, 20 and 31 (29 samples, 2.8%).
- No closure reaches a yield or an `EventTracker` send outside what the pilot already cuts [verified: tool output].
- **The local phase is not blocked by any single site.** Before the tier-2 hooks, 144 of the 169 bucket candidates were blocked, almost all through the generic base `Test` (§3, H7 and H8 reach 153 and 148 closures). After H7-H10 and the pre-warm list, 10 of 169 stay blocked.

## 1. Scope and method

1. **Candidates** [verified: tool output]:
   - *meta-rest*: `managed-callgraph.ts subtypes 'Sims3.Gameplay.Interactions.MetaInteractionDefinition`3'` (new subcommand) gives 49 concrete types; minus the 12 of v0 = 37.
   - *local-sampled*: every resolved or ambiguous non-meta definition row of the entry list (31 types).
   - *row5-candidate*: docs/75 row 5 (61 samples, 5.9%: a `Definition.Test` that calls the generic base `Test`, commodity search). Rebuilt from IL, not source text: concrete non-meta subclasses of `InteractionDefinition`3` named `Definition` whose own `Test` calls a generic base `Test` (`InteractionDefinition`3`, `SoloSimInteractionDefinition`1`, `ImmediateInteractionDefinition`3`, `ActorlessInteractionDefinition`3`, `InteractionDefinition`4`). **169** types; docs/75's text rule found 316 because it also counts names that only mention `base.`. The bucket's 61 samples cannot be split per type (docs/75 §6), so its verdict is a count.
   - *base-local*: the non-pilot base paths of the entry list (`CalculateScoreForObjectInteraction`, `InteractionDefinitionUtilities.SpecialCaseTests`, `UpdateCacheIfNeeded`, `LiveDragHelperModel.get_CachedTopDraggedObject`, `CheckAvailabilityTooltip`, `Motives.FunInteractionTest`, small getters).
   - *scoring-function*: the three sampled ones (`EatHereScoringFunction`, `SitInteractionModifier`, `GetBrushTeethScore`).
2. **Closure**: roots = `defRoots` (own or nearest `Test` + `CalculateScore`), depth 12, delegates not followed, virtual calls to the declared target only (as docs/118 and docs/121). Cuts: docs/121's two guards, the pilot's worker hooks (`IsAllowedInRoom`, `get_NumSimsDoingGardening`, `LocalizeString`, `DidSimsMeetOnline`, `GetSimCountForVenueWithCustomDesireFunction`, `GetPunishmentManagerFromSim`: docs/122 §3.5 and §12.5) and the tier-2 hooks H7-H10 (§3).
3. **Baseline**: the snapshot set is the 43 ICs of `docs/data/autonomy-proxy-ics.csv` (matched by method name, so `UTFConnector*` and `Sims3.UI` twins count). The pilot union (v0 + implementors + meta base path, same cuts) reaches 30 EA ICs, all in that set, and 6 managed write sites [verified: tool output]; a candidate's static write that the pilot union also reaches is not new.
4. **IC class** for an IC outside the set, from its docs/62 row: SAFE -> c; UNSAFE or MAIN -> b; a write verb in the name (`_Set`, `_Add`, `_Destroy`, `_Register`, ...) or a "queued" void IC whose name is not `Get`/`Is`/`Has`/`Find`/`Test` -> w; else a. Hand overrides [inferred, §4]: placement tests (`World_TestObjectPlacement*`, `UserToolUtils_CheckObjectPlacementImpl`), `World_FindPlacesOnRoad` and `Slots_GetMatrixOfSlotImpl` -> b; `World_GetObjectsImpl` -> d; `MonoScriptHost_GetEnumSimpleName` -> c (registered by the host itself, docs/119).
5. **Verdict**: blocked if the closure reaches a new b/w/d IC, a yield or event send, a new static write or static collection mutation not on the pre-warm list, or a write to a field of the definition's own type (the shared definition object); else new rows if it reaches a new a IC; else ready. Class-b ICs that the pilot already treats as abort branches (`Random_NextDoubleImpl` in 44 closures, `Slots_GetPositionOfSlotImpl` in 151, `Slots_CanAttachToSlotImpl` in 1) do not block: they abort the worker search as in docs/122 §3.2. Column `abort_branch_ics` lists them.

**Limit:** unresolved virtual calls (object-specific overrides) are not followed, so a closure can miss ICs. On the worker this costs an abort, not a wrong answer: the docs/122 guard thunk aborts `ic:<name>` on every IC not on the list. Mode R (docs/122 §4.3) counts them.

**Superseded by docs/127 (overrides followed, 2026-10-20):** with overrides up to 5 hops the verdicts of this note change for 177 of the 251 candidates (all candidates: ready 172 -> 18, new rows 61 -> 129, blocked 16 -> 102). The abort argument above does not hold for managed writes: a static write in an override body runs silently on the worker. All 37 meta-rest definitions are blocked by the rain/hail instance create (`InteractionInstance.sNextId`); with worker hook H11 (docs/127 §4) 28 are ready, 8 need new rows, 1 is blocked. In the local phase `World_IsOnRoofImpl` and `Query_GetGlobalObjects` become the most common new rows, and 31 `Test`s that build an actor route are blocked (route `Set*` ICs, I-127-2). Per candidate: `docs/data/autonomy-virtual-closure.csv`.

## 2. Results by group

| Group | Ready | New rows | Blocked | Hooked |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| meta-rest (37) | 37 | 0 | 0 | |
| local-sampled (31) | 21 | 4 | 6 | |
| row5-candidate (169) | 102 | 57 | 10 | |
| base-local (11) | 9 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| scoring-function (3) | 3 | 0 | 0 | |
| **Total (251)** | **172** | **61** | **16** | **2** |

Before the tier-2 hooks (`--no-tier2-hooks`): 79 ready, 6 new rows, 166 blocked (meta-rest 30/0/7, row 5 22/3/144, local-sampled 15/3/13, base-local 9/0/2) [verified: tool output]. H7-H10 are what opens the local phase.

Sampled rows by verdict (docs/75 rank, samples): ready includes `CalculateScoreForObjectInteraction` (8, 30), `InteractionDefinitionUtilities.SpecialCaseTests` (11, 22), `EatHereScoringFunction` (16, 9; its `CanAttachToSlot` is an abort branch), `CheckAvailabilityTooltip` (20, 6), the phone `CallDefinition` (23, 4, needs the `RoommateManager` pre-warm), `SocialInteractionA` and `InviteToJoinConversation` (24, 3), the TV and video-game definitions (51, 53). New rows: `JamWithInstrument` (28, `IsOnPlatform`), `SwimHere` (38, pool ICs), `FrugalTurnOff` (49, light dimmer), `LookOutWindow` (55, bounding box). Blocked: `CallPet` (13, 14 samples: writes `mSimPickerList` on the shared definition, as docs/75 §3 found), the scratch/freak-out group (47, placement test), `ChangeDoorbellSound` (55, `SetLotFrontDoor` through a lazy front-door lookup), `ViewObjects` (58, creates the drag UI model).

## 3. Tier-2 worker hooks and pre-warm list

Four managed hooks (ts3fixes, same owner and pattern as docs/122 §3.5; worker path only, the sim thread runs the original):

| Hook | Site | Why [verified in the decompiled class library] | Worker answer | Opens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **H7** | `LiveDragHelperModel.get_CachedTopDraggedObject` and `get_TopDraggedObject` | the generic base `Test` (`InteractionDefinition`3::Test`) walks the target's parent chain and compares each with the cached top dragged object. The getter fills a static cache on first use per search (the search clears it at its end); the fill builds the UI model singleton and asks the scene window, which reaches 7 `UIManager` ICs (`DestroyWindow`, `RegisterEvent` among them) and 6 static UI collections | the object captured at the cut (null when nothing is dragged) | 153 closures |
| **H8** | `Autonomy.UpdateCacheIfNeeded` | during a search the actor's cached test values are already filled (`mUseCachedValues`); otherwise it recomputes them (fire on lot, tomb room, party, household members), which reaches `World_GetWorldPositionImpl`, `CheckObjectPlacement` and fire-manager reads | cache active -> no-op; else abort `cache` | 148 closures |
| **H9** | `InteractionObjectPair.AddTuning` | a `Test` that builds a new pair (cloned parameters, playground and baby-pickup checks) fills two static `Dictionary` caches keyed by definition type and target type on a miss: a concurrent add with the sim thread can corrupt them | read both caches; miss -> abort `tuning` | 17 closures |
| **H10** | `Autonomy.get_IsSufficientlyOnScreenForHighLODSimulation` | every 60 ticks it recomputes the LOD flag and, on a change, sets a posture state-machine parameter (`SACS_SetParamImpl`, `SACS_UpdateEventFilterImpl`); reached from `Sim.IsSimInSituationWhichRulesOutMetaAutonomy` | the stored flag `mbHighLOD`, no recompute (at most 60 ticks stale; Mode R shows whether it matters) | 6 closures, all meta (`GoToLot`, `TakeFoodToLot`, `StayHome`, the three protest definitions) |

**Pre-warm** (one sim-thread call per load, then reads; added to docs/122 §3.5's list): `Household.RoommateManager` (lazy singleton, 8 closures, via `Sim.FamilyFunds` and the phone checks), `ScoringFunctionsForBabiesAndToddlers.sMaxHunger` (docs/121 §4.4), `AlchemyRecipe.mCachedCuriousDewRecipe`, and mscorlib lazies (`Encoding` UTF-8 instance, `MonoEnumInfo` cache, the CJK collation tables) that docs/122 §12.2 already accepts as idempotent first fills [verified for the game-side fields; inferred for the mscorlib ones]. CSV column `prewarm`.

## 4. New snapshot rows

26 distinct class-a ICs, all reached only by definitions with no blocker (column `new_ics`). Answer rule as docs/121 §2.2: a position-keyed IC is answered only for a position bit-equal to a row's position, else abort `pos`.

| Group | ICs (closures reaching) | Row content | Size | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Terrain and floor at a row position | `GetTerrainHeight` (15), `GetTerrainSurfaceType` (6), `GetTerrainType` (3), `GetFloorSurfaceType` (2), `HasFloorFeatures` (5), `HasFloorFeaturesWorldPos` (1), `GetTilesWithFloorFeatures` (1), `IsCameraRoutable` (10), `IsOnPlatform` (2) | per row: height, terrain type, surface types, floor-feature and camera-routable bits | +12 B per row | 1.5-2.5 h |
| Pools and ponds | `IsInPool` (16), `HasPool` (12), `GetPoolObjectIdForPoolBelowPosition` (2), `GetPondAtPoint` (3), `GetPondInfo` (3), `FindPondRepresentativePositions` (1) | per row: in-pool bit, pool id; per lot: has-pool; per world: pond table (docs/100 already maps ponds) | +8 B per row, ~0.5 KB per world | 1-2 h |
| Lot and room | `GetLotLocationAtFloor` (14), `GetRoomId` (1), `GetInformationAboutRoom` (1), `LotIsEntranceFromTargetPoint` (1), `LotGetDisplayLevelInfo` (1), `GetWorldToHouseboatDisplayPosition` (1) | lot location per (row, floor); room id and room info for the actor's lot; houseboat display transform per lot | ~1-3 KB per local search | 1-2 h |
| Object fields | `Objects_GetForward` (1), `Objects_GetBoundingBox` (1), `Objects_IsValid` (1), `World_LightGetDimmerImpl` (1) | per row: forward vector, bounding box, dimmer; valid = row present | +40 B per row | 0.5-1 h |
| Session | `World_GetWorldFileName` (1) | memo | < 0.1 KB | 0.25 h |

The table above was the first pass from the docs/62 scan. §4.1 reads every body (I-126-1, closed statically) and replaces its sizes: **all 26 are snapshot rows filled on the sim thread at the cut; none is blocked, none needs a memo.** The four groups touch the same state families as docs/121 §2.2 (WorldManager, lot grid, terrain, object components), so the docs/121 §8.4 rule holds: copy, never call live.

**Snapshot for local searches.** v0 builds rows for meta searches (docs/121 §3: ~100-250 rows). Local scoring targets every object on the actor's lot plus the Sims there: docs/59 §2.5 gives 30-100 KB on a busy home lot. With the §4.1 fields, **~155-170 B per row** instead of 64-80 (v0 fields + ~91 B), plus per-lot and per-world tables (§4.1 sizes).

### 4.1 Native bodies of the 26 ICs (2026-10-20, I-126-1)

Static only, as docs/122 §14.8: Ghidra headless on a copy of the `ghidra-ac121` project (`DecompileTo.java` depth 0 and 2, `DecompStores.java` depth 4 with the rebuild `0xC68680` and the lock helper `0x4E16F0` not expanded), plus a capstone pass over `game-copy/bin/TS3W.exe` with `functions.csv` boundaries: direct-call closure to depth 4, marking the lot-grid rebuild `0xC68680` (behind the reader `0xC688A0`), the terrain re-entrancy byte `+0x116` (`0xA8DF80`, docs/121 §8.4), the steering `+0x918` acquirers `0x82EDB0`/`0x82F0B0` and any `+0x918` operand, the routing lot-table gate sites `LotTable_Contains 0x628A90` and `LotTable_GetOrInsert 0x62EAB0`, the room read lock `0x106FB00` (`0xB96380`, `0xB95DF0`), `EnterCriticalSection`, `LOCK` prefixes, absolute global stores and the raise markers of §14.8 (`mono_raise_exception 0xEA18F0`, the `0xE77000` block, `RaiseException`, `_CxxThrowException`, `longjmp`, `abort`, `exit`). Managed signatures from the decompiled `ScriptCore.World` / `Objects` externs and the `Sims3.SimIFace` structs. Every body is cdecl (`ret` with no operand), so the stack dwords below are the managed arguments in order, after the hidden result pointer when the return is a struct over 8 bytes. `WM` = the WorldManager global `[0x11ECBC4]`; "lot" = the lot found by id through `0xC62D40` (`0xC60D30` plus the vtable `+0x40` type check) or by position through the grid (`0xC68990` -> `0xC688A0`). [verified unless marked]

**Correction (2026-10-20, docs/131 §9.4, depth 6 with indirect calls resolved):** the "no `+0x918`" sentence below is wrong for three ICs. #2 `GetTerrainSurfaceType`, #4 `GetFloorSurfaceType` and #18 `GetInformationAboutRoom` reach, at hop 5, `World_SurfaceTypeAtPoint 0xAB9580` -> `RoutingWorld_SurfaceAtPoint 0x834B80` -> `RoutingWorld_EnsureTerrainFootprints 0x8341D0` -> `RoutingWorld_UpdateTerrainFootprints 0x831710`, which takes the steering lock (`Lock_Acquire(world+0x918)` at `0x831748`), adds the level's terrain footprints and sets the level bit (`or [entry+0x168]` at `0x831B61`); it runs only when that bit is clear (`0x834216`) [verified]. And #18 writes its room object on every call: the room's embedded iterator (`0xC33810`/`0xC328B0`, cursor fields `+0x3C`, `+0x3E`, `+0x54`-`+0x60`) and, when the dirty byte `+0x34` is set, a rebuild of the room's region lists (`0xC33550`) [verified]. The other 23 bodies add nothing to the list below: depth 2 writes only out-parameters, results and locals. CSV: #2, #4, #18 are class `a-cut` (`tools/autonomy-tier2.ts`, `TIER2_CUT`). Rules that follow:

- **Filled on the sim thread at the cut, never on a worker, even with a lock:** all 26 (copy-never-call), and strictly #2, #4, #18 (`+0x918` footprint write, room object writes), #19 (gate sites), #25 (refcount), and the lot-grid rebuild / `+0x116` group.
- **Cut budget:** a fill that meets a clear bit runs a footprint update and **waits on `+0x918` whenever a routing job holds it** (docs/81: a job holds it for a whole plan; 55-66 ms/s of plan time) - one such wait is milliseconds, far over the docs/122 p95 of 0.3 ms [inferred from docs/81 timings]. The bit is clear from a lot's routing-graph (re)build (`0x6236D0` resets it at `0x624070` [inferred: lot graph build]) until the first terrain or floor surface query per level. Shim rule for `a-cut` rows: at the cut, look up the lot-table entry the way `0x8341D0` does (`LotTable_GetIfPresent`, then the level bit) and fill the row only when the bit is set; otherwise leave the row stale (the worker aborts on it, reason `cut`, and the sim thread's own call builds the footprints later). Cost of the check: one gate-site lookup (I-126-5). Mode R counts how often a row is skipped (I-131-8).

**Writes and locks, all 26 (original reading, depth 4, direct calls only).** No body or callee to depth 4 reaches the steering `+0x918` lock or any `+0x918` field. No global is written except two idempotent first fills: the config byte pair `0x11ECEEC`/`0x11ECEED` (`0xC88D80`, an option read cached once; the two floor-feature ICs) and a lazily fetched handle `0x11CB920` in the string code (`0x4F3CC0`, `GetFloorSurfaceType`). Both are set by any first caller and never cleared, so the pre-warm rule of §3 covers them. The other stores `DecompStores` keeps go to out-parameters, the hidden result, caller locals or fresh native buffers (`0xAEF2B0`'s store at `0xAEF38A` is into the local list it just built). Write-on-read paths, all already known from docs/121 §8.4: the lot-grid rebuild (11 ICs), the terrain `+0x116` byte (13 ICs) and the handle refcount (`LightGetDimmer` only). New against the v0 set: **four ICs reach the routing lot table** through `0xAB9580 -> 0x834B80` or directly (`0x6319A0`): `GetTerrainSurfaceType`, `GetFloorSurfaceType`, `GetInformationAboutRoom` and `LotIsEntranceFromTargetPoint` call `LotTable_Contains` (gate site 13) and `LotTable_GetOrInsert` (gate site 0, docs/86); `LotIsEntrance` asks `GetOrInsert` only after a `Contains` hit, so it never inserts [verified in `0x6319A0`; the other three paths not read to the end]. On the sim thread at the cut these are the game's own calls and pass `[RouteGate]` like any sim call (a possible wait for a running job, docs/86); on a worker they would race the routing job, so they must never be called live. Locks taken on the way: the room read lock `0x106FB00` (`GetInformationAboutRoom`, `LotGetDisplayLevelInfo`), a critical section at `+0x9A8` of the rain-puddle owner (`0xD6DE30`; the two floor-feature ICs) and the allocator's own critical sections. **No raise** on any path except the managed allocator behind the host slots, as §14.8: `+0x50` (string, `0xD7BD40`), `+0x88` and `+0x90` (array new, `0xD710A0` / `0xD71100`) reach `mono_array_new_specific` (overflow / out of memory) with native container counts as lengths, never an argument; `+0xA0` / `+0xA8` (`0xD71170` / `0xD71200`, element copies) are leaves. Indirect calls are not followed (between 0 and 52 per closure; the most in the string and floor-material ICs).

The world path writes only `mBoundCorner0..3` (`+0xC..+0x3B`), `mfWaterHeight` (`+0x6C`) and `mID` (`+0x70`); the shim writes the same fields and leaves the rest of the caller's struct as it was. Lot path's field set not read [inferred: same rule, mask taken from a recorded diff] |
| 15 | `World_FindPondRepresentativePositions` | `0x792630` | lot 0-1, ref float[] 2 | bool | lot 0, no lot or no vertices -> 0, **ref untouched** | lot pond vertices `0xAB5FA0` | host `+0x90` / `+0xA8` (allocator only) | per lot: the float payload (4 B per value), written only on true. The decompiler loses the copy's source registers; the count is the native vector's [inferred] |

The no-lot answer cannot be bit-equal (the game's own is undefined); the shim returns zeros there and Mode R must not count dwords 1-5 of a no-lot answer |
| 19 | `World_LotIsEntranceFromTargetPointImpl` | `0x7884B0` | lot 0-1 | bool | no routing world (`0x836200`, the docs/68 T4 site), planner flag `+0x974` clear, no WM or no lot -> 0 | planner `[world+0x95C]`, `LotTable_Contains`, then the entry's `+0x20 == 1` | **gates 13 and 0** (no insert) | per lot: 1 B |

**Verdicts: 26 snapshot rows, 0 memo, 0 blocked** (one per load: #26; per world: #13 world path, #14; per lot: #7, #15, #18, #19, #20, #21's flag; the rest per row). CSV: the 26 now carry class `a-row` in `new_ics` (`tools/autonomy-tier2.ts`, `TIER2_ROW`); candidate verdicts are unchanged (172 / 61 / 16 / 2).

**Sizes.** Per row: terrain and floor ~15 B (#1-#6, #8, #9 with the bits packed), pools ~13 B (#10-#13), lot and room ~23 B (#16, #17; +13 B on houseboat lots), object fields ~40 B (#22-#25): **~91 B per row**. Per lot: ~0.3-1 KB (#7, #18, #20 and the flags). Per world: the pond table at 124 B per pond, ~1-6 KB [inferred: 10-50 world ponds; the docs/100 pond count was not re-read], not ~0.5 KB as first guessed.

**What the shim needs that v0 did not have.** Partial outs (#14, #15, #16's room short, #21): the row stores which bytes the game wrote, and the shim writes only those, so the caller's in-values survive exactly as on the game's own call (same rule as the docs/122 §14.9 memo fix). Undefined not-found bytes (#18, #20): the compare masks them. Rows #2, #4, #18 and #19 must be filled on the sim thread only (gate sites); every other row also, by the copy-never-call rule. #2, #4 and #18 additionally only when the lot level's terrain-footprint bit is set (correction above).

## 5. Blocked

| Reason | Definitions | Fix, if any |
|---|---|---|
| Own-field write on the shared definition | `CallPet` (`mSimPickerList`), `Terrain+DEBUG_LightningStrike` (`mHitType`), `SpawnJob` (`Lot`) | stays on the sim thread; for `CallPet` the docs/75 per-tick cache idea (stage A) |
| Placement or road search (class b, §1.4) | scratch/freak-out group (3), `MartialArts+TeleportDuringMeditation`, `MagicCauldronRegency+TeleportPotion`, `ChangeDoorbellSound` | sim thread |
| `World_FindGoodLocation` (UNSAFE in docs/62) | `PondManager+IceSkateHere`, `OccultUnicorn+UnicornTeleport` | sim thread |
| Footprint toggle, object create | `PushableStatue+Move` (`ObjectEnableFootprint`), one create-out-of-world test | sim thread |
| `World_GetObjectsImpl` (class d) | `Terrain+SplashInPuddle` | as `Query_GetObjects` (docs/121 I-121-7) |
| Real static writes | `InteriorDesigner+TakeMeasurements` (`DesignModeSwap` event add), `SnowWaterFight+PlayWith` (`CauseEffectService` data allocation), `ViewObjects` (UI model singleton) | sim thread |
| Lazy front-door lookup that writes the lot (`SetLotFrontDoor`) | `ChangeDoorbellSound` | pre-warm per lot would open it (1 sample) |

Together these are 17 sampled samples (1.6%), 14 of them `CallPet` [verified: tool output + entry list].

## 6. What a tier-2 pilot needs, and effort

Units per CLAUDE.md (wall-clock for Claude with agents). On top of the docs/122 pilot (M5 + shadow), which tier 2 reuses.

| Step | Work | Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| Allow-list v1 | the 37 meta definitions into `docs/data/autonomy-allow.csv` (MVID, closure, verdict); no new driver, `ScoreMeta` already walks every meta ad | 0.5 h |
| H7-H10 + pre-warm list | four ts3fixes worker hooks, abort reasons `cache`, `tuning` (2 counter slots, docs/registry.md), pre-warm calls | 2-3 h |
| Local driver | `AutShadow.ScoreLocal`: replay of the local phase (B9-B12, docs/59 §1.2) per object on the actor's lot into own arrays, same rules as docs/122 §3.6 | 3-5 h |
| Local snapshot | rows for every object on the actor's lot and its Sims (docs/59 §2.5 builder), dirty-row updates via docs/76/79 | 2-4 h |
| §4 rows | 26 IC shims and their row fields; partial-out write masks (#14-#16, #21), learned keys (#1, #5, #7), masked compare for #18/#20 (§4.1) | 5-8 h |
| Mode R / W in game | local phase in shadow, abort reasons, compare | 2-3 h + 2-3 jobs + 1 clean night |
| **Total** | | **~15-23 h**, 2-3 game jobs, 1 clean night |

Order: allow-list v1 first (meta only, no new code paths: +2.8% of scoring), then H7-H10 with the local driver on the ready set (no §4 rows: ~27%), then §4 rows (~31%).

## 7. Open items

- ~~**I-126-1:** the 26 new class-a ICs are classified from the docs/62 scan only; read each body to depth 2 before its shim.~~ Closed statically in §4.1 (all 26 snapshot rows; ledger §170, I-126-5..9). Left for Mode R: the lot-path field set of `GetPondInfo` (I-126-7) and the indirect calls the closure does not follow.
- **I-126-5..9** (§4.1): gate-site waits added to the cut by rows #2, #4, #18, #19; partial outs; undefined not-found bytes; world pond table size.
- **I-131-7/8** (§4.1 correction, docs/131 §9.4): `a-cut` rows #2, #4, #18 can run the terrain footprint update under `+0x918`; fill them only with the level bit set, count the skips in Mode R.
- **I-126-2:** pairs per type in the local phase (docs/75 §6 counter) would replace the proportional split of the 142 shared base-path samples and the bucket ratio of row 5.
- **I-126-3:** H10 serves a flag up to 60 ticks old; Mode R must show whether any local or meta test answer changes with it.
- **I-126-4:** H7's copy taken at the cut answers `Root_TargetOnHandTool` the same as the per-search cache.
- Not split: the other unresolved local buckets (31 samples, 3.0%) and the `.ctor` base frame (9 samples); each row is under 0.6%.
- Ledger: docs/51 §167, §170 (§4.1).
