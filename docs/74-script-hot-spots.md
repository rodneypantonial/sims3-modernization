# 74. Script hot spots: Stereo, motive panel, tooltips and other cheap wins (PLAN gap 8)

PLAN.md "Gaps" item 8 named three managed hot spots from the older pooled samples: `Stereo.AddEnjoyingMusicCallback` 1.8%, `SimInfo.OnMotivesChanged` 1.1%, `TooltipManager` 0.5% of sim-thread samples. This doc re-measures them in the trusted 2026-10-16 samples, explains why each is hot from the extracted script DLLs, designs the smallest in-place fix that keeps game results identical, and adds the other cheap wins of the same kind from the top of the managed list. No game run was made. The four new fixes were built afterwards (2026-10-16, §10), opt-in and not yet run in game.

Tags: [verified] = read in the decompiled script DLLs (`game-copy/decompiled/`, from `tools/extract-assemblies.ts`; not copied here); [measured] = managed samples from the runs below; [inferred] = reasoning from both, not checked live.

## 1. Answer

| Hot spot | Share now, installed default (S3PP caches on) | Why it is hot | Fix | Expected saving |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Stereo.AddEnjoyingMusicCallback` | **0.27%** (0.11% / 0.51%); 1.92% only with S3PP `MonoTypeEHashProbe` + `MonoIsinstCache` off | every music pulse removes and re-adds the dance interaction; the remove scans the Sim's whole interaction list calling `GetType()` per entry, and `GetType()` is the Mono type-hash lookup S3PP caches | **none of ours**: S3PP's caches already remove ~90% [measured]; keep them on (docs/69) | 0 (already taken by S3PP) |
| `SimInfo.OnMotivesChanged` | **1.16%** (1.24% / 1.02%) | every motive update of every household Sim rebuilds that Sim's HUD info; for the selected Sim the motive panel then redraws all six bars, loading four UI images per bar, and the name getters run the localization lookup | **existing opt-in fixes**: `kMotiveBarImageCache` (docs/49) and `kSimNameCache` (docs/54); run their A/B and turn them on | ~0.6-0.7% = **6-7 ms/s** [inferred] |
| `TooltipManager.Simulate` | **0.61%** (0.90% / 0.17%) | a task that, every sim tick, asks the UI for the window under the cursor and walks its parent chain reading each window's tooltip text through a string IC | **new**: poll at most every 100 ms while the cursor stands still | ~0.4-0.5% = **4-5 ms/s** with the mouse idle [inferred] |
| `Lot.UpdateDetailPriority` (new) | **1.77%** (2.26% / 1.02%; 2.82% cache off) | every lot, every tick, builds the active household's actor list (two new lists) to see whether a player Sim stands on it | **new**: one active-household lot set per sim tick | ~1.5% = **~15 ms/s** [inferred] |
| `Cane.SimRequiresCaneWalk` (new) | **0.75%** | per route segment it searches the Sim's inventory for an active cane before looking at the walk style, though the answer is false for every style but five | **new**: test the walk style first (exactly the same answer) | ~0.4-0.7% = **4-7 ms/s** [inferred] |
| `Lot.GetHoursOfOperation` (new) | **1.09%** (0.79% / 1.54%) | `IsOpenVenue` (camera, autonomy, route plans, doors) re-reads two tuning dictionaries and scans all situations for a bachelor party on each call | **new**: memo per lot per sim tick | ~0.5-0.8% = **5-8 ms/s** [inferred] |
| `TombRoomManager.AboutToPlanRouteCallback` | **0.95%** | doors and stairs of the lot fetched again on every route plan | **existing opt-in** `kSpatialCache` (docs/20 §4a) | ~0.5-0.8% [inferred] |
| Moodlet grid rebuilds (`SimInfo.OnBuffsChanged`) | **0.75%** | every buff add/remove clears and reloads the moodlet grid | **existing opt-in** `kBuffGridInPlace` (docs/49) | ~0.5% [inferred] |

New fixes together: ~**28-35 ms/s** of sim-thread time (2.8-3.5%); turning on the four existing opt-in fixes adds ~**17-23 ms/s** [inferred, 1% of samples ~ 10 ms/s as in docs/data/results/2026-10-16-queue-s3pp-cache.md]. All of it is BP only: the trusted runs are BP; IP has no managed samples from 2026-10-16.

## 2. Data and method

- **Runs (trusted, sampler fixed 2026-10-16):** `s3pp-cache-2026-10-16-bp-s3pp-cache-on` and `-off` (PASS run 01:43 UTC, build 2b45b85, 885 managed samples each) and `mainstack-2026-10-16-bp-mainstack` (586 samples). Files: `probe-out/profile/<run>-managed.jsonl` (one C# stack per line, innermost first; `tools/probe/managed-sample.mjs`). The verify runs of 2026-10-16 have no managed samples (repro mode samples the main thread only), and the lotstream runs ran no managed sampler.
- **Appended files:** `managed-sample.mjs` appends, so both s3pp-cache jsonl files also hold the FAIL run of 01:14 UTC (1,762 and 1,770 lines). Only the last N lines (N = `samples` in the matching `-managed.txt`) are used. The FAIL-run halves give the same picture (OnMotivesChanged 1.47-1.60%, `UpdateDetailPriority` 2.03-2.28%, Stereo 0.23% on / 1.92% off) [measured], but are not counted.
- **Default config** = cache-on run + mainstack run (both have S3PP's Mono caches on, the installed default): 1,471 samples, 411 with no script running. The cache-off run is shown for reference only.
- **Shares** are the samples whose stack contains the frame (inclusive), over all samples. With 5-30 hits per item, the error is about ±20-45% of the share (Poisson). ms/s uses 1% of samples ~ 10 ms per second of sim-thread time.
- **Analysis:** a throwaway node script over the jsonl (shares, caller and callee splits); nothing committed. The older 1.8% / 1.1% / 0.5% come from the pooled pre-2026-10-16 samples (docs/35, docs/43); whether those runs had the S3PP caches on was not checked.

## 3. `Stereo.AddEnjoyingMusicCallback`

**Measured.** 1 of 885 samples (0.11%) with the caches on, 3 of 586 (0.51%) in mainstack, 17 of 885 (**1.92%**) with them off. With the caches off, 15 of the 17 sit in `GameObject.RemoveInteractionByType` and 13 have `System.Object.GetType` as the leaf; all 17 come from `ReactionBroadcaster` through `BroadcastCallback.Invoke` (our `BroadcasterPulseHook` above it) [measured].

**Why [verified].** The stereo (and each wired or wall speaker) owns a `ReactionBroadcaster` whose enter callback is `AddEnjoyingMusicCallback`. The broadcaster pulses about once per sim minute and calls the enter callback for each Sim in range the first time and again every `PulseRepeatTime` sim minutes (default 20, `ReactToMultiplePulses` default true). Each call, for a non-pet Sim on the stereo's lot: removes and re-adds the `EnjoyingMusic` buff (both fire `BuffsChanged`, so a household Sim also gets a HUD and moodlet-grid refresh, §4), then `RemoveInteractionByType(typeof(DanceTogetherA.Definition))`, then `AddInteraction(new DanceTogetherA.Definition(...), checkForDuplicate: true)`. The remove walks the Sim's whole interaction list and compares each entry's `InteractionDefinition.GetType()` with the type; the add walks it again with `InteractionObjectPair.Equals`. A Sim's list is long, and in the embedded Mono 1.2.3 `GetType()` goes through the type-hash lookup `0xEBBDE0` / `mono_metadata_type_equal 0xEA8720` (docs/29 §5), which is what S3PP's `MonoTypeEHashProbe` caches.

**Fix: none of ours.** The S3PP caches already take the cost from 1.92% to 0.11-0.51% [measured]. The remaining work is the game's intended semantics: the buff remove/add resets the buff's timeout, and the interaction remove/add moves the entry to the end of the list (pie-menu and autonomy enumeration order). Skipping either would change game results, so no dedupe is safe. If S3PP were ever dropped, the same lookup would have to come back as our own type cache (docs/69 #1/#3); that is not planned.

## 4. `SimInfo.OnMotivesChanged` (motive panel)

**Measured.** 11 of 885 (1.24%) and 6 of 586 (1.02%) samples carry `SimInfo.OnMotivesChanged`; `HudModel.UpdateSimInfo` from any trigger is 1.81% and 2.22% [measured]. Split of the motive path in the default config (17 samples): motive bar image loads 5, Sim name getters 4, other motive bar work (size, colours, tag, arrows) 4, the rest of `UpdateSimInfo` 4 (motive colours, current moodlet, celebrity level). The buff path (`SimInfo.OnBuffsChanged`, 11 samples, 0.75%) is mostly the moodlet grid rebuild [measured]. In these runs `MotiveBarHook.Update` and `NameCacheHook.get_*` are on the stack but call straight through to the originals: both switches were off (tuning default) [measured].

**Why [verified].** `HudModel` subscribes each household Sim's `Motives.MotiveChanged` to that Sim's `SimInfo.OnMotivesChanged`. `Motives.UpdateMotives` fires the event at the end of every motive update, so every household Sim's update rebuilds its `SimInfo`: name (through the localized name getters, docs/54), sex, age, occult info, celebrity progress, mood colours, the enemies mood penalty, and per motive the UI value, colours and current moodlet. Only when a motive UI value changed and the Sim is the selected one does `SimMotivesChanged` fire; the motive panel then calls `MotiveBar.Update` for all six bars, and each bar loads its moodlet icon and three background images with `UIManager.LoadUIImage` even when nothing about them changed (docs/49: 58 of 59 `LoadUIImage` samples).

**Fix: turn on what exists.** No new fix is needed for the two biggest parts:
- `kMotiveBarImageCache` / switch `motivebar` (`mods/ts3fixes/src/UiCaches.cs`, counters 74-75): skips the four image loads while the bar's moodlet icon and background row are those the game last set. Takes the image loads (5 of 17, plus 1 on the buff path), ~0.4% [inferred].
- `kSimNameCache` / switch `namecache` (`NameCache.cs`, counters 78-79): names from a cache keyed by the stored name text. Takes the name part, ~0.27% [inferred].
- `kBuffGridInPlace` / switch `buffgrid` (counters 76-77) covers the buff-path grid rebuilds, ~0.5% [inferred].

Rejected: skipping bars whose inputs did not change (the motive values decay on every update, so nearly every bar changes [inferred]); skipping the name read for the motive context (would delay a rename's `SimNameChanged`, not identical); coalescing to one refresh per UI frame (docs/43 candidate 2): the event already fires once per Sim update, which `SimUpdate` throttles to 2 high-LOD Sims per tick (docs/04a), so there is little to merge [inferred].

## 5. `TooltipManager.Simulate`

**Measured.** 8 of 885 (0.90%), 4 of 885 (0.45%, cache off), 1 of 586 (0.17%). 7 of the 8 cache-on samples sit under `WindowBase.ShouldShowTooltip`, 5 with `UIManager_GetStringPropertyImpl` as the leaf; the rest are `GetWindowFromPoint`, `GetParentWindow`, the custom-control lookup and the tooltip-callback dictionary [measured]. The spread between runs follows where the cursor rests (the harness never moves the mouse, `game-window-hands-off`).

**Why [verified].** `UIManager` starts one `TooltipManager` task at UI init. Its `Simulate` is an endless loop that sleeps one tick (`Simulator.Sleep(0)`) per pass. Each pass gets the cursor position and the window under it, then walks from that window up through every parent; for each it asks `ShouldShowTooltip`, whose base version reads the window's tooltip callback (a dictionary lookup) and its `TooltipText` (a string property IC, the string marshalled into a new managed string) until one answers. Then it compares the result with the last pass and starts or times out the tooltip with two stopwatches (show after 1.5 s, hide after 15 s by default). With the cursor resting on a deep HUD window the walk reads several strings per tick, at ~33-44 ticks per second [measured iteration rate, s3pp-cache Analysis].

**Fix design (new, `TooltipThrottle`).** Replace `TooltipManager.Simulate` with the same loop plus one gate: run the walk only if the cursor position changed since the last walk or at least `kTooltipPollMs` = 100 ms of wall time (`Environment.TickCount`) passed; otherwise just sleep one tick. Everything else (timing, create, show, hide, dispose task) is the game's code path unchanged.
- Game results: identical. The task only reads UI state and shows or hides tooltip windows; no sim state depends on it [verified: no gameplay calls in the loop besides the tooltip callbacks, which build UI].
- What changes for the player: a tooltip may appear up to 100 ms later than its 1.5 s delay, and a tooltip whose text is set while the cursor stands still appears up to 100 ms later. Below what anyone can see [inferred].
- Saving: with the cursor still, 33-44 walks/s become 10/s, ~70-77% of the cost; with the cursor moving, nothing changes. ~0.4-0.5% = 4-5 ms/s with the mouse idle [inferred].
- Risk to check first: the task starts at UI init, possibly before `Ts3Fixes.Instantiator`'s static constructor patches methods. If `Simulate` is already running, the patch helper's "already compiled" guard refuses it and `ts3fixes.applied` says so. Fallback in that case: at world load, destroy the running `TooltipManager` (found through `Simulator` by type) and add a new one, which runs the patched body. Decide after reading `ts3fixes.applied` from one load [inferred: order unknown].
- **As built (§10):** the gate sits on `Sims3.UI.UIManager.GetWindowFromPoint` instead of a replaced `Simulate`. When that lookup returns null the game's loop just sleeps one tick and changes no state [verified], so answering null to the tooltip task (identified by `Simulator.CurrentTask`) while the cursor rests and < 100 ms passed is the same gate without copying the loop. The restart fallback above would not work: `Patch` refuses any method already compiled, and a new `TooltipManager` would run the same compiled `Simulate`. So a refused patch leaves the fix inert, and `Apply` logs `TooltipManager.Simulate at patch time: already running / not started` to answer the order question from the first load.

## 6. Other cheap wins from the top of the managed list

Looked at: the top 45 self and top 150 inclusive non-IC frames of the default config. Kept only the ones where a cache, early-out or dedupe keeps game results identical.

### 6.1 `Lot.UpdateDetailPriority`: one lot set per tick (new, biggest)

**Measured.** 20 of 885 (2.26%), 25 of 885 (2.82%, cache off), 6 of 586 (1.02%); in the default config 16 of its 26 samples are in `Household.get_AllActors`, 5 in `get_LotCurrent`, 2 in `get_ActiveHousehold`, 1 in the IC [measured]. docs/04a §5 had flagged it as a steady per-lot drag, cost then inferred.

**Why [verified].** `Lot.Simulate` runs for every lot; each pass calls `UpdateDetailPriority`, which calls `CalculateDetailPriority` and hands the answer to the native `World.LotSetDetailPriority`. `CalculateDetailPriority` returns `Home` if the lot is the active household's home lot, else `PlayerSim` if any active-household actor has this lot as `LotCurrent` and is not in a rabbit hole, else `None`. The actor loop reads `Household.ActiveHousehold.AllActors`, which builds a pruned description list and a new actor list on every call. So every lot pays two list allocations and a walk of the household per tick.

**Fix design (new, `DetailPriorityCache`).** Hook `Lot.CalculateDetailPriority` (private, no arguments). Keep the `Home` test live (one field compare). Replace the actor loop with a lookup in a per-tick set of lots: built on the first call in a sim tick from `ActiveHousehold.AllActors` (lots of actors with no rabbit hole), keyed on `Simulator.TicksElapsed()` plus the household reference, at most 100 ms old, never kept while paused (same rules as `SpatialCache.cs`). `World.LotSetDetailPriority` is still called on every pass, so the native side sees the same call sequence.
- Game results: the value is a streaming/detail hint for the native world, never read back by script [verified: the script DLLs only set it, there is no getter]. The only difference: an active-household Sim that changes lot in the middle of a tick is seen by the lots simulated later in that tick one tick late. A verify switch computes both answers and counts mismatches.
- Saving: from one actor-list build per lot per tick to one per tick. ~1.5% = ~15 ms/s in BP [inferred]; more in towns with more lots.

### 6.2 `Cane.SimRequiresCaneWalk`: walk style first (new, exact)

**Measured.** 11 of 1,471 (0.75%; 0.79% / 0.68% / 0.56% per run), 9 of them in `Inventory.FindAll` under `Cane.GetActiveCaneForActor`; the callers are `SimWalkStyleRules.PostProcessWalkStyle` from `GetAdjustedWalkStyleForRoute`, for every route sub-path and portal [measured].

**Why [verified].** `SimRequiresCaneWalk(sim, style)` first finds the Sim's active cane (`Inventory.FindAll<Cane>` builds a list from every inventory stack, then looks for one with `UsingCane`), and only then switches on the walk style: it can return true only for `Run`, `FastWalk`, `FastJog`, `Jog` and `FastRun`. For every other style (`Walk`, swim styles, `Stomp`, ...) the inventory search is wasted. `GetActiveCaneForActor` has no side effects.

**Fix design (new, `CaneEarlyOut`).** Hook `Cane.SimRequiresCaneWalk`: return false at once when the style is not one of the five; otherwise call the original. Same answer in every case [verified: the original returns false for all other styles after the search]. Saving: the share of calls with a non-running style; most routes walk [inferred], so ~0.4-0.7% = 4-7 ms/s. A counter for early-outs vs calls shows the real share.

Not done: an inventory "has a cane" index (needs add/remove hooks on `Inventory`); the early-out takes most of the cost without state.

### 6.3 `Lot.GetHoursOfOperation`: memo per lot per tick (new)

**Measured.** 16 of 1,471 (1.09%; 0.79% / 1.54% per run). Callers: `Lot.IsOpenVenue` from `Camera.GetClosestVisibleLot` (camera task), `Autonomy.CheckAvailabilityOnLot`, `SimRoutingComponent.AboutToPlanRouteCallback`, `DoorSingleGender.IsAllowedThrough`, `VisitCommunityLot.SharedVisitVenueTests`. Inside: `Situation.GetSituations<BachelorParty>` 6, `MetaAutonomyManager.GetTuning` and `Bartending.TryGetBarData` dictionary lookups (with enum keys through the default comparer) 7 [measured].

**Why [verified].** The ref overload reads the venue's meta-autonomy tuning, then asks `Bartending.TryGetHoursOfOperationExtended`: bar data for the venue type, and for a bar lot a scan of **all** live situations (a new list) for a started `BachelorParty` on this lot, which moves the closing hour. Bar data and tuning are static tuning; the venue type changes only in edit mode. Both false paths leave the ref outputs untouched [verified].

**Fix design (new, `HoursMemo`).** Hook `Lot.GetHoursOfOperation(ref float, ref float)`. Per lot, remember (result, open, close) for the current sim tick (same tick key, 100 ms cap and pause rule as §6.1); a hit writes the refs only when the result was true, as the original does. Game results: identical except a bachelor party that starts on that lot in the middle of a tick, seen one tick later; the verify switch counts mismatches. Saving: every repeat call in a tick, ~0.5-0.8% = 5-8 ms/s [inferred]; the hit counter tells.

### 6.4 Existing opt-in fixes that cover the rest

- `TombRoomManager.AboutToPlanRouteCallback` 0.95% (9 of its 14 samples in `Lot.GetObjects`): `kSpatialCache` (docs/20 §4a, counters 62-64) answers repeated (type, lot) queries within a tick. Unmeasured in game.
- Motive panel, names, moodlet grid: §4.

### 6.5 Looked at, not a cheap identical fix

| Frame | Share | Why not |
|---|---|---|
| Dictionaries with enum or `ulong` keys through the default comparer (`Enum.Equals`/`GetHashCode` boxing): `IsInteractionProvidingBenefit`, `ZombieDanceTimeOut.HasStereoOnTheLot` (every lot every tick, EP7), `TryGetBarData`, `GetTuning`, buff and trait `GenericManager` | ~1.0% spread over ~10 dictionaries, none above 0.5% [measured] | a typed comparer needs the dictionary rebuilt; a rebuilt Mono 1.2 dictionary can enumerate in a different order (chains rebuilt), which is a game-result change wherever the game iterates it. Only for dictionaries the game never enumerates, one by one; not worth it now |
| `LotManager.UpdateObjectLot` -> `InternalOnSetRoomAndLevel` | 1.97% | real work per room change event |
| `Sim.SwitchToOutfitWithSpin` | 1.09% | outfit generation (random outerwear, transformation outfits) |
| `Sim.IsAllowedInRoom` -> `RecalculateAllowedRoomsIfNecessary` | 1.09% | already a versioned cache; the cost is the version lookups and real recomputes |
| `CommodityInteractionMap.RemoveInteractionForCommodity` (`List.Remove` with `InteractionObjectPair.Equals`) | 0.75% | on object removal; an index would change list order |
| `SimUpdate.CalculateSimEnvironmentScore` | 0.95% | objects in the Sim's room, real work |
| `Camera.Simulate` -> `GetClosestVisibleLot` | 0.82% | mostly `IsOpenVenue` (taken by §6.3) and `AllActors` |
| `Lot.UpdateReactions` / broadcasters | 3.67% | ours already: `kBroadcasterThrottle` |
| `Route_Plan` and other routing ICs | ~15% self | native route search, docs/04, docs/64 |

## 7. Repro and verify plan

All new fixes follow the house pattern: tuning switch default **off** until measured, a runtime switch for in-load A/B (`patches {name: true/false}`, memory `bundle-testing`), counters, and for the two tick memos a verify switch that runs the original too and counts mismatches. One bundle run per world, BP first.

1. **Build** (main session, not this doc): add the four hooks to `mods/ts3fixes` (one file, e.g. `ScriptHotSpots.cs`), tunings `kDetailPriorityCache`, `kCaneEarlyOut`, `kHoursMemo`, `kTooltipThrottle`, switches `detailprio`, `caneearly`, `hoursmemo`, `tooltipthrottle`, plus `detailprioverify` / `hoursmemoverify`. Read `ts3fixes.applied` after one load: all four patches in (the tooltip one is the order risk, §5).
2. **Mismatch check (one BP load, verify switches on):** both memos compute the original as well; pass = 0 mismatches over 10 minutes of play at speed 3, or only same-tick lot/party changes logged with the Sim or lot id.
3. **In-load A/B:** a managed-sampler profile (`profile-world`, 10 min) with each switch flipped at the midpoint, and `stall-split.ts` on the two halves. Pass: the frame's share falls as expected (§1), no new script errors, 0 stuck Sims. Same for the existing opt-in fixes `motivebar`, `namecache`, `buffgrid` (repro `ui-motivebar-cache` exists in `tools/harness/repros.json`), `spatialcache`.
4. **By eye (Rodney, no harness mouse):** tooltips on HUD buttons still show after ~1.5 s and hide on leave; motive bars, moodlet icons and the moodlet grid look as before.
5. **IP:** repeat 2-3 in IP (more lots and venues; the detail-priority and hours memos scale with lots).

Repro entries to add with the build (memory `repro-actions`): `detail-priority-cache` (switch active household / travel a Sim between lots: counters rise, mismatches 0), `cane-early-out` (an elder with a cane runs and walks), `hours-memo` (bar lot with a bachelor party starting), `tooltip-throttle` (counters only; no mouse).

## 8. Counter slots (reserved 2026-10-16 in docs/registry.md, array raised to 90)

The build took the 10 slots from 80 and raised the array from 80 to 90 in both `Fixes.cs` and `PatchHandlers.cs`:

| Proposed | Switch | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 80-82 | `detailprio` | answers from the tick set, tick sets built, mismatches (verify) |
| 83-84 | `caneearly` | early-outs, calls passed to the game |
| 85-87 | `hoursmemo` | memo hits, misses, mismatches (verify) |
| 88-89 | `tooltipthrottle` | walks skipped, walks run |

Agent `patches` keys: `detailprio_hits/_sets/_mismatches`, `caneearly_skipped/_passed`, `hoursmemo_hits/_misses/_mismatches`, `tooltipthrottle_skipped/_walks`. No ts3native counters are needed.

## 9. Ledger

Rows I-74-1 to I-74-8 in docs/51 §8.

## 10. Build status (2026-10-16, not run in game)

| Fix | Hook | Tuning (default) | Switches | Counters | Repro |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| §6.1 detail priority | `Lot.CalculateDetailPriority` | `kDetailPriorityCache` (off) | `detailprio`, `detailprioverify` | 80-82 | `detail-priority-cache` |
| §6.2 cane early-out | `Cane.SimRequiresCaneWalk` | `kCaneEarlyOut` (off) | `caneearly` | 83-84 | `cane-early-out` |
| §6.3 hours memo | `Lot.GetHoursOfOperation(ref, ref)` | `kHoursMemo` (off) | `hoursmemo`, `hoursmemoverify` | 85-87 | `hours-memo` |
| §5 tooltip throttle | `Sims3.UI.UIManager.GetWindowFromPoint` | `kTooltipThrottle` (off) | `tooltipthrottle` | 88-89 | `tooltip-throttle` |

- Code: `mods/ts3fixes/src/ScriptHotSpots.cs` (hooks), `TickMemo.cs` (game-independent `TickStamp`, `RefSet`, `HoursMemo`, `PollGate`); offline self-test `node tools/selftest/hotspots/run.ts` (stamp rules incl. clock wrap, reference set vs a list model, hours memo vs a write-only-on-true model over 50k calls, poll gate) passes.
- Verify switches check **one answer in 8** against the game's method and return the game's answer, so an A/B half with verify on keeps most of the saving; a mismatch is counted, not logged per lot (deviation from §7 step 2's "logged with the Sim or lot id": cheaper, and the allowed causes are rare).
- Tick memos follow `SpatialCache.cs`: rebuilt on a new `Simulator.TicksElapsed()`, after 100 ms of wall time, on an active-household change (detail priority), and never kept while paused.
- Draft queue `tools/harness/queues/ts3fixes-hotspots.json` (BP + IP, 12 min, bundle `--ab detailprio,hoursmemo,caneearly,tooltipthrottle`, 3-min slices, repro `hotspots-verify` turns both verify switches on for the load); `queue.ts --dry-run` parses it. Not run. The `--ab` mode runs no managed sampler, so the share drop per frame (I-74-4, I-74-8) needs a second, sampler run (`profile-world` without `--ab`, switch on vs off) once the mismatch check passes.

## 11. Script-side hitches left in the v0.1.5 runs (2026-10-24, read-only)

Follow-up to `docs/data/results/2026-10-24-v015-hitch-causes.md` causes 5, 6, 8 and 9. No game run, build or code change. Inputs: `-hitches.jsonl` task lines (`from` = where the run resumed, `to` = where it yielded) of the five tagged release runs plus every 2026-10-23/24 run for frequency; managed samples (`-managed.jsonl`) placed on hitches by `tools/harness/worst-hitches.ts --since 2026-10-24`; the IL call index (`game-copy/analysis/callgraph/index.json`, `tools/managed-callgraph.ts`). Runs are short and noisy: treat counts < 5 as anecdotes.

| Finding | Cause | How often | Fix idea + hook point | Gain | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (a) `ScriptCore.ScriptProxy: Dispose` (SV 497 ms, BP 148 + 139 ms) | 448 of 1,002 managed samples inside any `ScriptProxy.Dispose` (180 runs) sit in one world-wide query: `GameObject.Dispose(bool)` asks `LotCurrent.GetObjects<T>()` and calls `SeasonalLotMarker.Remove(ObjectId)` on each result; for an object on the world lot that is `WorldLot.GetObjects<T>` = `Queries.GetGlobalObjects<T>` (`Query_GetGlobalObjects`), a walk over the whole world. Owners: off-lot Sims leaving the world (275 samples, also `Inventory.DestroyItems` for their inventory and `CarOwnable.OnReservingSimDisposed`), traffic cars `CarNpcWithNoDriver` (206; also `Car.TurnHeadlightsOff` effect destroy), sea life and insect jigs, ingredients, phones | release runs: Dispose >= 100 ms 8 in ~92 min (IP 5), >= 300 ms 1 (SV); all 10-23/24 runs: IP 68 >= 100 ms in 23 runs, often a flat ~100-115 ms (the query) | `seasonmarkercache` (new, off): patch the non-generic `Sims3.SimIFace.Queries.GetGlobalObjects(Type)` the way `SpatialCacheHook` patches `GetObjects(Type, ulong)`; for `typeof(SeasonalLotMarker)` only, answer from a live set kept by postfixes on `SeasonalLotMarker.OnStartup` (add) and `SeasonalLotMarker.Dispose` (remove), seeded by one real query per world load, never while paused in build/buy; verify switch compares 1 in 8 with the real query. Every other type falls through | the query share of Dispose (~45%), so a ~100 ms world-lot Dispose drops to its non-query rest; >= 100 ms Dispose in IP ~0.5-1 per 10 min fewer; >= 300 ms freezes ~0.1 per 10 min (the 497 ms one is an unknown owner) | owner split and query share verified (samples); the type argument `SeasonalLotMarker` inferred from the IL call order (I-74-9); per-owner cost inferred |
| (b) Sim ThreadedObjects run to the next yield (SV soak 530 ms, IP 287 / 290 / 277 ms, IP 406 ms) | Every case resumes at `Sim.DoInteraction` and yields at `RouteBackoffHook.AsyncWait`: the new interaction's own work up to its first async route START. The one run with managed samples (IP 287 ms, 2 of 2 samples) is **ours**: `GoToSchoolInRabbitHole` -> `RabbitHoleHook.RouteNearEntranceAndEnterRabbitHole` (switch `rabbithole`, on) -> `Ts3Fixes.Fixes.SafeSpot` -> `FindGoodLocation`, up to 5 searches before the placed Sim plans its last metres (docs/95 §5.1 school-run burst). Across all 10-23/24 samples of Sim interaction work outside routing and animation, `SafeSpot` `FindGoodLocation` is the largest single family (58 of 1,943: rabbit hole 35, `GoHomeHook` 23), then `DogDig` `FindGoodLocation` 19; the async START handshake itself (`Route_GetOption` under `PlanAsync` / `AsyncKindStart`) 64. The IP 406 ms run (resume and yield both at `AsyncWait`) holds a sync `ReplanFromPosition` of 145 ms (boat, route side: docs/87 A10 / docs/176) | DoInteraction -> AsyncWait runs >= 250 ms: release runs IP 4, SV 2 in ~92 min (~0.65 per 10 min); all 10-23/24 runs IP 23, SV 5, BP 0 | 1. turn on `safespotreuse` (built, off: answers from the stored FGL result of a verified spot) after its verify run; 2. new `safespotyield` (off): in `SafeSpot`, `Simulator.Sleep(0)` after each `FindGoodLocation` when `Simulator.CheckYieldingContext(false)` and the current task is the Sim's own (both hook callers, `RabbitHoleHook.EnterHook` and `GoHomeHook.Run`, run in the Sim's interaction task); the Sim has not moved yet, so a yield changes no outcome, only re-checks `TownieUnseen`/`FarFromViewers` after it | the sampled case 287 -> ~100-150 ms (one FGL per tick); the unsampled ones only if they are the same family | sampled case verified; SV 530 / IP 277-290 owners unknown (outside sampler windows) |
| (c) `NpcParty.ForcePlaceSim` one-shot 421 ms (SV soak) | `NpcParty+DisplayInvitation.EnsureHostAtHome` (an NPC party's invitation alarm, in a `OneShotFunction` task) -> `TryGetPositionForSim(host, LotHome)`: `CreateObjectOutOfWorld` (a temporary object), `Lot.GetRandomPosition`, `FindGoodLocationInSameRoom`, a sync `PlanToPointRadius` (the iteration's plans: 23 + 19 ms), `Destroy` of the temporary object; then `ForcePlaceSim` resets the host and sleeps (the run's yield). The run started fresh (`from` empty), so the 421 ms is everything before that first `Sleep` | once per NPC party whose host is away; `ForcePlaceSim` runs >= 100 ms: 6 in all 10-23/24 runs, >= 300 ms 1 | no dedicated fix: rare, and the parts are native searches with no cache key; (a) cuts the temporary object's Dispose if it sits on the world lot (inferred); a yield between the steps would need a copy of `TryGetPositionForSim` (not worth it) | ~0-100 ms on a rare event | call sequence verified (IL index); split of the 421 ms inferred |
| (d) 609 ms iteration with no timed stage (SV `release-check-...-sv-rc-smoke`, s 135, `[HitchAttr]` on) | All timed stages of that iteration sum to ~18 ms (script 12, threaded 6); no task line >= 2 ms, no route plan, no `+0x918` wait, no GC mark > 2 ms, no lot add; not a harness call window. ~590 ms ran on the sim thread outside every stage timer (native work inside `Simulate` that is neither Mono, the task lists, routing, animation, locomotion nor publish) | 1 in all release runs | none until attributed: a hitch-triggered native stack grab (the native sampler was off in that run, `--no-sampler`) | - | cause unknown (measured: what it is not) |

Notes:
- (a) also explains part of the BP soak's 303 ms iteration (two Disposes in one tick, 148 + 139 ms) [inferred: no samples on it]. Traffic car despawns are frequent in BP (206 samples) but mostly < 100 ms there; IP's larger object count makes the same query cost ~100 ms [inferred].
- (b) is the third time `SafeSpot` shows up (docs/95 §5.1, docs/141 §7.1): the shortcut saves a long walk but pays up to 5 native placement searches in one run. `safespotreuse` and `safespotcap` exist and are off; `safespotyield` would be the cheap complement.
- Counters for `seasonmarkercache` / `safespotyield`: reserve in `docs/registry.md` before building. Ledger rows I-74-9 to I-74-12 in docs/51 §314.

Status (2026-10-24, offline build, no game run):
- I-74-9 **verified** from the IL: `GameObject.Dispose(bool)` has one MethodSpec call, `callvirt` token `0x2B000013` at IL+0x54 = `Sims3.Gameplay.Core.Lot::GetObjects<Sims3.Gameplay.Objects.SeasonalLotMarker>` (metadata read of `Sims3GameplaySystems.dll` with System.Reflection.Metadata). The virtual resolves to `WorldLot.GetObjects<T>` on the world lot -> `Sims3.Gameplay.Queries.GetGlobalObjects<T>` -> `Sims3.SimIFace.Queries.GetGlobalObjects(typeof(T))`, whose result is cast `as T[]`. No class derives from `SeasonalLotMarker` in the game DLLs.
- (a) `seasonmarkercache` built (off, tuning `kSeasonMarkerCache`, `mods/ts3fixes/src/SeasonMarkerCache.cs`): hook on `Sims3.SimIFace.Queries.GetGlobalObjects(Type)`; for `typeof(SeasonalLotMarker)` only, answers a fresh `SeasonalLotMarker[]` from a list kept by postfixes on `SeasonalLotMarker.OnStartup` (add) and `SeasonalLotMarker.Dispose()` (remove, after the body), seeded by one real query per world load; passes to the game while paused, in build/buy, outside live mode or on the `[AutShadow]` worker. Every 8th answer is the real query compared in order; one mismatch turns it off for the session. Counters 270-275. Repro draft `ip-world-dispose-loop` (not run).
- (b) `safespotyield` built (off, tuning `kSafeSpotYield`, `Fixes.cs` `SafeSpotYield`): `Simulator.Sleep(0)` after each `FindGoodLocation` in `SafeSpot` when `Simulator.CurrentTask` is the Sim's own and `MayYield()` (the same gate as Overwatch stuck-check yields: `CheckYieldingContext` plus ts3native's nested-call answer); after the yield the Sim must still exist, be unseen (`TownieUnseen`) and its target far from viewers, else SafeSpot returns false and the caller runs the game's own trip (counts in the caller's no-spot counter too). Counters 276-278. Repro draft `ip-school-run-safespot-loop` (not run).

## 12. `disposespread`: clean-up bursts spread over ticks (2026-10-24, built, not run)

Follow-up to §11 (a). `seasonmarkercache` (other branch) cuts the cost of one world-lot Dispose; this switch cuts how many land in one tick. Static only: decompiled game code, the IL index, the 995 existing `ScriptProxy.Dispose` managed samples. No game run.

### 12.1 Where the bursts come from

`ScriptObject.Destroy` only calls `World.RemoveObjectFromObjectManager` and `Simulator.DestroyObject`; the cost is the `ScriptCore.ScriptProxy: Dispose` task the engine runs afterwards (every sampled Dispose stack has `ScriptProxy.Dispose` as its root frame, no script caller above it) [verified, samples]. So a burst = several Destroy calls close together, from different tasks. Disposed type of the 995 samples: `Sim` 275, `GameObject` (base only) 218, `CarNpcWithNoDriver` 206, `SeaLifeJig` 65, `Ingredient` 49, `InsectJig` 38, `OneShotFunction` 29, `Phone` 28, other < 20 each [verified].

| Owner | Destroy call | Burst? | Deferred? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Townies leaving the world | `Sim.GoToVirtualHome+GoToVirtualHomeInternal.Run` ends in `Actor.FadeOut(yield: true, destroyObject: true)` then `Sleep(uint.MaxValue)` (6 sites); alarm fades of NPCs (`DaycareSituation`, `CityHall`, `OccultUnicorn`, `GenieLamp`, `Urnstone`, `SimDescription`, `MovingSituation`). All reach `GameObject.DestroyObjectOnFadeOutCallBack` | visitors sent home together (situation end, venue close) arrive and fade together; the fade time is the same constant [inferred] | yes, hook 1, Sims only |
| Service Sims | `Service.OnAssignmentFinished` queues `Sim.DestroyMyself` on every Sim of the finished assignment: `FadeOut`, `RemoveFromWorld`, `Sleep(30)`, `Destroy` | yes, one loop per assignment [verified, code] | yes, hook 2 |
| Traffic cars | `CarNpcWithNoDriver+LiteDriver.Simulate` -> `DriveOffscreenAndRelease`: `DriveAwayInNpcCar` (route off screen), `Release(fadeOut: true)` (= `RemoveFromWorld`, `DestroyOnRelease` is false for them), `Destroy` | per car, from its own 2-6 h alarm; coincidences only [inferred] | yes, hook 3 |
| Inventory items (`Phone`, `Ingredient`, books) | inside the owner Sim's `Dispose` (`InventoryComponent.Dispose` -> `Inventory.DestroyItems`) | yes: one leaving Sim = one Dispose per item [inferred] | no: they run inside a Dispose, after the hook point, and the inventory they sit in is being torn down; deferring would leave items in a dead inventory. Spreading the owner Sims spreads these with them |
| Sea-life / insect jigs, glasses, food, flowers | owner objects' own fades and state machines (`MarineLifeStateDestroy`, spawners) | rarely together | no: mostly on lots and visible, and callers keep using the slot (spawner counts, parent slots) |
| `CarOwnable.OnReservingSimDisposed` | inside the Sim's Dispose | with its Sim | no (inside Dispose) |

Not deferred on purpose: `Sim.DestroyMyselfAndSleep` (horse in a rabbit hole, rare), `DEBUG_KillSimImmediate`, any Destroy whose caller reads the object or its slot afterwards (e.g. `Urnstone` fades then destroys at once: our queue entry then finds it destroyed and only counts it).

### 12.2 Design

- Hooks (`DisposeSpread.cs`): 1. `GameObject.DestroyObjectOnFadeOutCallBack` (private, the fade's destroy callback, alarm or yield path), only when `this` is a `Sim`; 2. `Sim.DestroyMyself.Run`, the game's own body with the `Destroy` queued, then `Sleep(uint.MaxValue)` (the Sim waits out of the world; our `Destroy` ends its task); 3. `CarNpcWithNoDriver.DriveOffscreenAndRelease`, the game's own three calls with the `Destroy` queued. Each hook runs the game's body unchanged when the switch is off.
- Queue: the existing `SliceQueue<T>` (FIFO, most waiting, longest wait; its offline self-check is `tools/selftest/slicequeue`). Cap 16: more = the game's immediate `Destroy`. One drain task (`OneShotFunctionTask`, started on demand like `stuckcheckasync`) destroys `kDisposeSpreadPerTick` = 1 per tick, oldest first. A count, not a time budget: the Dispose runs after our slice in the engine's own task, so our slice cannot see it.
- Safety, at enqueue (else the game's path, counter 283): switch on; game state live (not saving, travelling, build/buy, CAS, world unload); not destroyed; a Sim is neither selectable nor in the active household; the object is out of the world, or `!World.IsObjectOnScreen` and `FarFromViewers` (camera reach + 80 m from every active-household Sim). A Sim at hook 1 is already at opacity 0.
- Destroyed meanwhile: at its turn an object with `HasBeenDestroyed` is only counted (286).
- Flushes: `OptionsModel.SaveGame(bool, bool, bool)` hook destroys everything waiting before the save starts (sync and async saves; the save itself unchanged); the drain also destroys everything at once when it sees a save in progress, travel or a non-live state (build/buy, edit town); at world unload (`IsWorldShuttingDown` / not in world) the queue is dropped, the world destroys everything then. A task the unload killed leaves its queue, which the next enqueue clears (counted as dropped).
- Outcome vs the game: the same objects destroyed, the same way, up to 16 ticks later. The game already lives with a doomed object in the world for the whole fade (`kGlobalObjectFadeTime`) before its callback; the extra ticks only extend that window.

Switch `disposespread`, tunable `kDisposeSpread` (False), agent `patches {disposespread: true}`. Counters 280-289 (registry): queued, destroyed by our task, destroyed by a flush, game path (unsafe/not live), most waiting, longest slice us, already destroyed, queue full, dropped (unload, threw), longest wait in ticks. Trigger `Ts3Fixes.Fixes.DisposeSpreadNow(mode, n)`: `fade` (n unseen homeless NPC Sims fade out together: a forced burst through hook 1, stress), `gohome` (the same Sims through `Sim.MakeSimGoHome`), `cars` (n traffic cars get their own drive-off flag). Repro `bp-disposespread-burst-loop` (A/B arms off/on/on/off, not run).

### 12.3 Expected gain and risks

- Gain: a tick with k world-lot Disposes from these owners pays one instead (~100 ms each before `seasonmarkercache`, its non-query rest after). The BP 303 ms iteration (148 + 139 ms) would split into two ~150 ms ticks if both were from these owners [inferred: no samples on it]; the SV 497 ms single Dispose is one object and is not touched. Frequency: §11 counts ~1 tick >= 300 ms in ~92 min from Dispose; this removes the multi-Dispose share of the >= 100 ms ones, size unknown until the repro runs. Combined with `seasonmarkercache` the per-tick Dispose cost should drop below ~50 ms in most cases [inferred].
- Risks: (1) a doomed Sim stays in the world (faded or out of the world) up to 16 ticks longer; a script that picks that Sim again (situation, story progression) in that window gets a Sim we then destroy. Same as during the game's own fade, only longer [inferred]. (2) A save that starts and ends inside one tick of an unhooked save path (travel save) stores a waiting object; hook 2 and 3 objects are out of the world, hook 1 Sims are faded townies whose descriptions stay valid. (3) Overwatch / ErrorTrap scans in the window see the waiting objects. (4) Patches on three game methods and `OptionsModel.SaveGame`: a mod that replaces those methods' bodies (none known in the installed set, docs/128 scan not re-run) would be overwritten or overwrite ours.
- Verify plan: the repro with `/taskstall` (Dispose lines per iteration, off vs on), a save during an on arm (`disposespread_flushed` > 0, no faded Sim after reload), a travel and a build/buy entry with a full queue, then the soak bundle A/B on IP where Dispose hitches occur (§11: IP 68 >= 100 ms in 23 runs).
