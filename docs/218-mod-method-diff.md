# 218. Per-method mod guard: which replaced game methods the worker closures reach

Written 2026-10-30. Static only: no build, no game run, no queue. Contributor research task (Rodney, round 2, task 1).

**Question:** `[AutShadow]` turns itself off for the whole session when the `Sims3GameplaySystems` / `Sims3GameplayObjects` MVID pair is not on its accept list (docs/122 §4.1 step 4, G-M1 in docs/128 §5). A per-method guard (docs/122 §12.4 item G) would turn off only what a mod really changes. For each mod that ships its own copy of a game script assembly: which methods differ from the game's, and which of those can the worker reach?

**Output:** `docs/data/mod-method-diff.csv` (`mod, assembly, type, method, il_hash_ea, il_hash_mod, differs, reachable_from_worker, notes`, 891 rows). Tool: `tools/mod-method-diff.ts` (`--self-check`).

Tags: **[verified]** = from the tool output or the assembly bytes; **[inferred]** = reasoning, not run.

## Summary

- **3 mods on the reference install ship game script assemblies:** simler90's core mod (SGS, SGO), NRaas ErrorTrap (`ScriptCore`), and the tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 patcher output (`UI`, `Sims3StoreObjects`, and SGS / SGO patched over the core mod) [verified].
- **simler90 UPDATE242 changes 467 methods and adds 1; 77 of them are in a worker closure** [verified]. Only 3 are in the v0 pilot union (`Autonomy.CheckAvailabilityOnLot`, `MetaAutonomyTuning.GetIntensity`, `Household.IsGreetedOnLot`) and 6 in a direct tier-2 closure. The other 68 are reached only through overrides (`-typed`, `-cha`).
- **ErrorTrap: 15 changed and 44 added methods, 4 reachable**, all only through overrides (`Simulator.DestroyObject` by the class-hierarchy walk; `Simulator.AddObject`, `CreateObject`, `ScriptProxy.SetLogic` by the typed run) [verified]. None is in a v0 or direct tier-2 closure, which matches docs/128 §2.2.
- **tiny-ui-fix's own changes reach no SGS / SGO closure method** (70 + 27 changed, 0 reachable). 7 of its `UI` / `Sims3StoreObjects` changes are on the typed tier-2 closure, through UI calls [verified].
- **No tier-2 verdict changes with any of the three** [verified]. `autonomy-tier2.ts` and `autonomy-virtual-closure.ts` re-run on each mod's assemblies give the EA verdict for 251 of 251 and 270 of 270 rows.
- **The MVID is not a content identity** [verified]. tiny-ui-fix's `UI.dll` and `Sims3StoreObjects.dll` carry the game's exact MVIDs with different bytes and 195 / 14 changed methods. Its SGS / SGO keep the MVIDs of the core they were patched over. Its re-patched NRaas DLLs keep their original MVIDs. So an MVID list accepts a patched copy of an accepted module without notice.
- **Recommendation (§5):** key the accept list by a hash of the module bytes, not by MVID. For a module that is not on the list, check the token-normalized IL hash of only the closure methods of each enabled definition, and turn off only the definitions whose closure has a differing method. Keep the session switch for a module that cannot be hashed.

## 1. Method

1. **Inputs.** Every `.package` under `<Documents>\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods` and the Steam install, read-only, plus `--pkg` files. All S3SA assemblies are pulled with `extract-assemblies.ts`. A module counts as a game module copy when its module name is a game script assembly (`ScriptCore`, `SimIFace`, `Sims3GameplaySystems`, `Sims3GameplayObjects`, `Sims3Metadata`, `Sims3StoreObjects`, `UI`, `mscorlib`, `System`, `System.Xml`) and its bytes differ from the game's. The comparison is by bytes, not by MVID: a copy with the game's MVID is compared too (§4).
2. **Method identity.** Methods are matched by full id (`Type::Name(params)`, from each module's own metadata). Compiler-generated names (`<PrivateImplementationDetails>{GUID}` switch tables, `CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate#`, `<>c__DisplayClass#`, `CS$<>8__locals#`, lambda and iterator bodies) are folded, so a plain recompile does not count as a change. A method whose id carries such a name is matched to its renamed twin by the folded id.
3. **Method hash.** `il_hash_*` is the first 16 hex digits of the SHA-256 of `ilShape()` (`managed-callgraph.ts`). It contains the opcodes with short and long forms folded, branch targets as instruction indices, tokens resolved to member names, locals and exception clauses. Max stack and init-locals are left out. Two copies with the same source and different token numbering hash the same.
4. **Notes.** For a changed method, the note lists calls and stores the mod adds (`+call`, `+stfld`, `+new`) or removes (`-`). It says "calls and stores unchanged: branches, constants or locals" when only the logic moved, with the IL line counts.
5. **`reachable_from_worker`**, most direct label first:

| Label | Reached by |
|---|---|
| `v0` | the docs/122 pilot union: v0 definitions, the 7 `HowMuchItWantsSimToCome` implementors, the meta base path; no overrides |
| `v0-typed` | the same roots, with the receiver-typed override run of docs/127 (`autonomy-virtual-closure.ts --edges`, 5 hops) |
| `v0-cha` | the same roots, overrides by class hierarchy only, 5 hops (over-approximates) |
| `tier2` | a docs/126 ready or new-rows candidate, direct closure |
| `tier2-typed` | any docs/126 candidate's typed override run (ready or blocked: the edges file does not keep the verdict) |
| `tier2-cha` | a ready or new-rows candidate, class-hierarchy overrides, 5 hops |
| `tier2-blocked`, `tier2-blocked-cha` | only through blocked candidates |
| `no` | none of the above |

The reach set holds 29,391 method ids: v0 967, v0-typed 285, v0-cha 2,885, tier2 1,461, tier2-typed 22,769, tier2-cha 824, tier2-blocked-cha 200 [verified].

## 2. Result per module

| Mod | Module | MVID | Methods | Changed | Added | Changed and reachable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| simler90 core UPDATE242-Steam | Sims3GameplaySystems | `bb8cb38b…` | 75,877 | 398 | 0 | 69 (v0 3, v0-cha 1, tier2 6, tier2-cha 2, tier2-typed 57) |
| simler90 core UPDATE242-Steam | Sims3GameplayObjects | `a95a143f…` | 55,581 | 69 | 1 | 8 (v0-cha 2, tier2-typed 6) |
| NRaas ErrorTrap v100 | ScriptCore | `99b5bd68…` | 4,669 | 15 | 44 | 4 (v0-cha 1, tier2-typed 3) |
| tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 | UI | `618382f8…` (the game's) | 14,957 | 195 | 31 | 6 (tier2-typed) |
| tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 | Sims3StoreObjects | `bd729220…` (the game's) | 6,741 | 14 | 9 | 1 (tier2-typed) |
| tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3, against the core it patched | Sims3GameplaySystems | `8fc5bf3a…` (the input core's) | - | 70 | 9 | 0 |
| tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3, against the core it patched | Sims3GameplayObjects | `5a2a1248…` (the input core's) | - | 27 | 9 | 0 |

No mod removes a game method. The tiny-ui-fix SGS / SGO rows are its patch alone: they compare its output with the core it was run over (a local rebuild of the simler90 core with extra fixes, `--against`). That input is not public, so those 115 rows are not reproducible as they stand. Running the patcher over the shipped core and then `--against` the shipped core gives the same kind of row.

**simler90, the 9 direct-closure changes [verified]:**

| Label | Method | Change |
|---|---|---|
| v0 | `Autonomy.CheckAvailabilityOnLot` | logic only (IL lines 184 -> 190) |
| v0 | `MetaAutonomyTuning.GetIntensity` | logic only (194 -> 197) |
| v0 | `Household.IsGreetedOnLot` | +`get_IsPetHousehold` |
| tier2 | `Autonomy.CalculateScoreForSocial` | +3 `simler90.Other` checks, +`Sim.TestCurrentOutfitRevealing` |
| tier2 | `SocialInteractionA+Definition.CanSocializeWith` | +Bonehilda and resort front-desk checks |
| tier2 | `GoOutToYard+Definition.Test` | +household / `RoommateManager` checks |
| tier2 | `TraitFunctions+SwipeSomething+Definition.Test` | +`Other.KleptoSwipeLotCheck` |
| tier2 | `Sim+GoToVirtualHomeMeta+Definition.CalculateScore` | +`get_IsGhost` |
| tier2 | `ImprovedProtestSituation.CanProtest` | +`Other.CanProtestPoliceFix` |

**Changes on a reachable method that add a write [verified, from the notes]:** `Sim.GetCategoryAndIndexToUse` (+`set_CareerOutfitIndex`, v0-cha only; the typed run does not reach it), `Sim.SwitchToOutfitWithoutSpin` (+`stfld OutfitInfo.RevealingScore`, tier2-typed), `Occupation.ApplyOccupationUniform` (+`set_CareerOutfitIndex`), `Genetics.MakeSim` (+`set_VoicePitchModifier`, tier2-cha), `Sim.GrantUFOsToAliens` (+`CarOwnable.SetOwnerLot`), ErrorTrap `ScriptProxy.SetLogic` (+2 `stfld`). Every one of them is reached only through overrides, and the re-run classifiers (§3) keep their verdicts. A write behind an override is still a write on the worker if that override runs, which is what the per-method guard has to catch.

## 3. Verdicts with each mod's assemblies [verified]

Each mod's assemblies were put over the game's in a scratch folder, indexed with `managed-callgraph.ts build`, and both classifiers were re-run on that index:

| Assemblies | `autonomy-tier2.ts` (251 rows) | `autonomy-virtual-closure.ts` (270 rows, plain / typed / CHA) | Rows with mod overrides |
|---|---|---|---|
| EA | baseline | baseline | 0 |
| simler90 core UPDATE242-Steam | 0 change | 0 change | 0 |
| NRaas ErrorTrap v100 | 0 change | 0 change | 0 |
| tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 (`UI`, `Sims3StoreObjects`, its own DLLs) | 0 change | 0 change | 0 |

So none of the three adds a blocker that the classifiers see: no new native IC and no new managed write on the closures they build. This agrees with docs/128 §2.1 for simler90. The per-method diff is still needed, for two reasons. First, the writes in §2 sit behind overrides, which `autonomy-tier2.ts`'s direct closure does not walk. Second, a changed branch in a closure method changes what the worker does without changing which methods the closure contains.

## 4. The MVID does not identify the content [verified]

| Module | Where | MVID | SHA-256 (first 12) | Changed methods vs the reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UI.dll | game | `618382f8afc8ef4abec3ccf3956ee8cb` | `212c119ecb7e` | - |
| UI.dll | tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 | `618382f8afc8ef4abec3ccf3956ee8cb` | `38baa3730309` | 195 changed, 31 added |
| Sims3StoreObjects.dll | game | `bd729220cca85a459609352de1e7ccd4` | `8ff310620877` | - |
| Sims3StoreObjects.dll | tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 | `bd729220cca85a459609352de1e7ccd4` | `0908d829c293` | 14 changed, 9 added |
| NRaasErrorTrap.dll | NRaas_ErrorTrap.package | `9649edd603f98a43b7d3215479126cae` | `7d0477871be1` | - |
| NRaasErrorTrap.dll | tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 | `9649edd603f98a43b7d3215479126cae` | `e3da38bc514c` | (not a game module; not diffed) |
| NRaasMasterController.dll | NRaas_MasterController.package | `b2f3807e42e4144a9f0abcbc7c54e7d8` | `0eb4a1245914` | - |
| NRaasMasterController.dll | tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 | `b2f3807e42e4144a9f0abcbc7c54e7d8` | `4f353f1ab483` | (not a game module; not diffed) |

tiny-ui-fix rewrites assemblies in place and keeps each input's MVID. Its SGS / SGO on this install carry the MVIDs of the core it was run over. Run over the shipped simler90 core, they would carry `bb8cb38b…` / `a95a143f…`, which is accepted set 1 in `AutShadow.kMvidSets` [inferred: same tool behavior as the 4 modules above]. `[AutShadow]` would then accept 70 + 27 changed methods without logging anything. None of them reaches a closure today (§2), but the next patcher version can change that.

The same gap applies to `kScriptCoreMvids` (an ErrorTrap `ScriptCore` patched by a rewriter would keep `99b5bd68…`) and to the known-MVID skip in `offload-override-scan.ts` (docs/132).

## 5. Guard recommendation

1. **Accept list by content, not MVID.** Each accepted module gets an entry of module name and SHA-256 of the assembly bytes, as the S3SA resource holds them. Today that is 2 SGS / SGO sets and 2 `ScriptCore` builds. A module with the same MVID and different bytes counts as unknown. The bytes are in the S3SA resource at load. The in-game code still has to read them, either from the resource or from the loaded image's raw data (Mono 1.x `MonoImage.raw_data` / `raw_data_len`; offsets not checked in this exe [inferred]). Cost: one hash per game-module copy, once per session, a few ms for 13 MB [inferred].
2. **Unknown module: per definition, not per session.** Ship a table of `(method id, il_hash)` for the closure methods of each enabled definition, from the EA build and each accepted set. Use the CSV's hash definition. For a module not on the list, hash only those methods of that module (v0 today: 967 + 285 typed, 2,885 more with the hierarchy walk) and compare. Turn off only the definitions whose closure has a missing or differing method, and log their names. The hash needs tokens resolved to member names (§1.3), so it is native work on the loaded image's metadata, or a managed walk if the game's `mscorlib` exposes method bodies (not checked) [inferred]. Use the typed closure for the check. The class-hierarchy closure is the safe fallback, at about twice the methods.
3. **Session switch only when the guard cannot run:** an unreadable image, a hash failure, or a module from a loader the guard does not see (MonoPatcher's run-time swaps are already handled by the L3 check, docs/128 §5).
4. **Keep L3 (G-M4)** for run-time method swaps. A body hash cannot see a swap that leaves the IL alone and redirects the method pointer.

What this would change on the reference install [inferred, from §2 and docs/128 §2.1]: with simler90 accepted by content, nothing changes. With an unknown simler90 build, the session would stay on, and the definitions whose closure contains `CheckAvailabilityOnLot` or `IsGreetedOnLot` would go off. That is most of v0, so the gain is a clean log rather than more definitions. The gain is real for mods that change a few methods: ErrorTrap (0 direct-closure methods) and tiny-ui-fix (0 SGS / SGO closure methods) would keep every definition on.

## 6. Limits

- **Static.** A changed branch can route the worker into a method that the EA closure does not contain. The per-definition check covers it only if the closure is rebuilt on the mod's index. §3 does that for the three mods here: 0 verdict changes.
- **`tier2-typed` does not split ready from blocked candidates**, because the `--edges` file keeps the candidate group, not its verdict. Read it as "some tier-2 candidate".
- **Mods that add types** (subclasses of closure classes, docs/128 §2.4) are not in this table; that is G-M5's census.
- **Only the reference install.** Other script mods that ship game-module copies would need a re-run. One command per package (§7).
- **The tiny-ui-fix SGS / SGO delta** is computed against a non-public input core (§2).

## 7. Reproduce

```
node tools/managed-callgraph.ts build --asm game-copy/assemblies --out <scratch>/cg_ea
node tools/autonomy-virtual-closure.ts --asm game-copy/assemblies --index <scratch>/cg_ea/index.json --edges <scratch>/typed_ea.json > /dev/null
node tools/mod-method-diff.ts --asm game-copy/assemblies --index <scratch>/cg_ea/index.json --typed <scratch>/typed_ea.json \
  --pkg "<simler90GameplayCoreMod-UPDATE242-Steam.package>=simler90 core UPDATE242-Steam" \
  --pkg "<NRaas_ErrorTrap.package>=NRaas ErrorTrap v100" --csv <scratch>/a.csv
node tools/mod-method-diff.ts ... --pkg "<tiny-ui-fix.package>=tiny-ui-fix 1.5.3 (own changes)" --against <core it was patched over> --csv <scratch>/b.csv
node tools/mod-method-diff.ts --self-check --asm game-copy/assemblies
```

Pass `--game` / `--user` to scan a whole install instead of single packages (about 60 s). For §3, copy a mod's assemblies over `game-copy/assemblies` in a scratch folder, index it, and run `autonomy-tier2.ts` and `autonomy-virtual-closure.ts` with `--asm <folder> --index <folder index>`.

`managed-callgraph.ts` change in this branch: `indexAsm()` is split out of `loadAll`, the self-check output is byte-identical, and `loadStandalone()`, `ilShape()` and the `#US` heap offset are added for single-module use.

## 8. Implementation (round 7 task 2, 2026-11-01)

The §5 recommendation as built: branch `fix/autshadow-content-guard`, switch `autshadow` (no new switch: the guard decides
whether the existing switch can act). ts3native contract 11, counters 2022-2025, ledger §905.

**Accept list by content.** `AutShadowNative.ImageSha(MonoImage*, byte[32])` (ts3native internal call, contract 11) hashes
the bytes Mono holds for a loaded module with BCrypt SHA-256 (`raw_data` / `raw_data_len` at MonoImage +0x08 / +0x0C,
checked by the `MZ` header; I-905-1). The managed side gets the MonoImage pointer from `Module._impl` (I-905-2).
`AutShadow.ModuleCheck` hashes every non-BCL game module once per game session, at the first `GuardSweep` (the world load
with `autshadow` on: ts3native registers its internal calls at the first Simulate tick, after ts3fixes starts). Accepted:

| Module | Builds |
|---|---|
| Sims3GameplaySystems + Sims3GameplayObjects | as a pair (G-M1): EA Steam 1.67, simler90 UPDATE242 Steam |
| ScriptCore | EA, NRaas ErrorTrap (VersionStamp 100) |
| SimIFace, Sims3Metadata, Sims3StoreObjects, UI | EA |

A module that is not accepted no longer turns the session off. When any module cannot be hashed (an older ts3native, no
`_impl` field, a failed hash), the MVID gate of docs/128 runs as before and its log line says why.

**Unknown module: per definition.** ClosureSweep's G-M6 hash check (PR #112) already hashes the 688 closure methods on
every load. With a module not on the content list it also hashes, in those modules only, the class-hierarchy overrides
the closures can dispatch to: `AutShadowChaLists.Methods`, 2,882 keys from `tools/autshadow-cha-lists.ts` (5-hop
class-hierarchy closure of each owner's own roots, the run §1 labels v0-cha; the shared base path is left out, since through
`InteractionDefinition.Test` it reaches every definition in the game, and definition receivers have the exact-type check).
A method whose hash is in no checked build skips only the owners whose closure reaches it (bit masks per method, as
`AutShadowLists.MethodOwners`). `tools/autshadow-il-hashes.ts` hashes both lists per build into one table (4,477 hashes).

**Fault rule by content.** More than 3 closure misses in modules whose bytes are accepted means our hash disagrees with the
runtime (guard fault, as before), since equal bytes cannot give different IL. With the modules unhashable it falls back to
the MVID list.

**Counters.** [2022] modules hashed (-1 = MVID gate), [2023] modules not accepted, [2024] hierarchy methods hashed, [2025]
of those differing from every checked build (`autshadow_content_modules`, `autshadow_content_unknown`,
`autshadow_gm6_cha_methods`, `autshadow_gm6_cha_mismatch`).

**Limits.**
- A type that a mod adds inside a game module and that overrides a closure slot is not in either list (G-M5 sees only mod
  assemblies). docs/218 §2 found 1 added method in all three mods' game modules, none reachable.
- The IL hash is not folded for compiler-generated names (§1's ilShape is). simler90's build differs from EA's in 906 of the
  3,570 keys by this hash, against 77 reachable changes by §2. Both are accepted builds, so the union covers them. A module
  rewritten by another tool could show misses on methods it did not change. The Tiny UI Fix run checks that (task 2 test).
- Cost: the hash runs once per game session (about 30 MB of modules); the hierarchy pass only with an unknown module.

**Test (round 7 task 2).** (a) The user's install (their own core and Tiny UI Fix): AutShadow must stay on, and G-M6 misses
only on methods that core changed. (b) The same with Tiny UI Fix moved out: the same A0-A3 pairs and the same misses. (c)
The reference core: "accepted set 1 (by content)", no misses.

**Results (2026-11-01, CI build of this branch, queue `autshadow-content-guard`, Baseline-BP, 5 min, Mode 0; rows in
`docs/data/results/2026-11-01-queue-autshadow-content-guard.md`) [verified]:**

| Arm | Modules hashed | Not accepted | G-M6 misses (closure) | Hierarchy misses / hashed | Owners skipped | Requests | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| a. player's install (own core + Tiny UI Fix), 2 runs | 7 | 4 | 96 | 862 / 2,616 | 17 | 478, 522 | PASS, PASS |
| b. same, Tiny UI Fix moved out | 7 | 2 | 82 | 624 / 2,492 | 17 | 700 | PASS |
| c. reference core (simler90 UPDATE242) | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 / 0 | 0 | 642 | PASS |

- All 7 game modules were hashed in every arm, so the MVID gate never ran. AutShadow stayed on in arms a and b (requests
  counted, no "off for the session" line) and skipped 17 owners there.
- The reference core is accepted by content with no miss, and the hierarchy pass does not run.
- The player's core leaves 2 modules unaccepted. Tiny UI Fix adds 2 more and 14 closure misses (its bundle carries
  patched copies of the core DLLs). Both arm-a runs gave the same counts.
- Not checked: that each miss is a method the player's core or Tiny UI Fix changed. The counters give counts only, and
  the applied log names only the first lines.
- One more arm-a start (the first) froze on the startup loading screen, before the main menu: not responding, CPU idle.
  It was killed after 4 minutes. The two reruns of the same arm loaded and passed. This change runs only when a world has
  loaded (the hash runs from GuardSweep), so the freeze is not from it [inferred]. There was no hang capture.

## 9. EA app 1.69.47 build (2026-11-13, EA-only branch `feature/ea169-autshadow-hashes`)

On the EA laptop parity run of v0.2.11 (docs/260 §7.5, setup with simler90 UPDATE242 as the core, so SGS + SGO are accepted
set 1) [AutShadow] skipped 17 owners: ScriptCore, SimIFace, Sims3Metadata, Sims3StoreObjects and UI are EA 1.69 builds, not on
the content list. docs/260 counted 11 differing methods; that is the log cap (closure lines stop after 11, hierarchy lines
after 10). The real count, by `tools/autshadow-il-hashes.ts --one` on the EA 1.69 modules plus simler90's SGS + SGO, is
56: 1 closure method (`GameUtils::GetWorldType`, IL hash 49edb73e, the same hash the game logged) and 55 hierarchy methods
(7 `SimBuilder` methods in SimIFace, 48 Sims3StoreObjects methods, mostly `ConfigureInteraction` overrides) [verified].
Their owner masks give exactly the 17 owners the game logged [verified].

**Review.** Every one of the 56, and every one of the 961 keys that differ on a vanilla EA 1.69 install (all 7 modules EA's),
has the same normalized IL as Steam 1.67 (`managed-callgraph.ts ilShape`: opcodes, member names of every token, constants,
strings, branch targets, EH clauses, local types): 957 equal, 4 equal once compiler-generated names are folded
(`InteractionInstance::CreateTooltipCallback` with its renamed closure class, whose `.ctor` and lambda body are equal too;
`Localization::FillInTokens`, `Localization::LocalizeOpportunityToken`, `Sim+Dare+Definition::TestDareRestrictions` with
their `<PrivateImplementationDetails>` string-switch caches) [verified]. The hash differs only by raw tokens it cannot name
(generic instances, `0a000119` in the game's GetWorldType trace) and by those generated names. Same body = no new icall,
no new write, no yield and the same callees as the cleared Steam build, so all 56 (and all 961) are safe for the worker.

**Change.** `tools/autshadow-il-hashes.ts` hashes EA 1.69 (`game-copy/assemblies-ea169`) as a fourth build:
`AutShadowIlHashes.Known` 4,477 -> 5,438 hashes, KnownMvids + 7 EA 1.69 MVIDs. ts3fixes only, no ts3native change. Offline
check: 0 misses for EA 1.69 + simler90 SGS/SGO, 0 for vanilla EA 1.69 (3,569 of 3,570 keys; the missing one is the old
closure class `.ctor`, renamed in EA 1.69), 0 for Steam 1.67. The content list (`kShaOther`) is unchanged: the EA modules
still log "not on the content accept list" and still get the per-definition pass, which now passes.

**In-game check (planned):** the parity job on the EA laptop with this package: no `G-M6 skips` and no `mod guard G-M6`
line; counters [603] = 0, [2025] = 0, [606] = 0; [2024] = hierarchy methods hashed (> 0); the G-M5 skip of
`VisitCommunityLot+Definition` (LynMods override) stays, as on Steam. Requests and jobs counted for the 16 owners.

**In-game check [verified, 2026-11-13, EA laptop].** The docs/260 §7.5 arm A parity job (`ea-v0211-bp-live`: BP load
+ 10 min live play, `TS3_ROW_RAW=1`) with this package (`build/ts3fixes.package` of f84cf23a, sha256 2647fca7…, pinned as
`fixesPackage`), the v0.2.11 EA native pair unchanged (asi ab5a24af…, rc ini 6363aae1…), EA `queue.ts` of
`sims-3-pr290-harness` (d9d4dac0), `--no-smoke`, game muted, no big CC. Bin backed up whole and restored after (436
files, hashes equal except game logs).

| Check | Parity run (a563cf8f) | This package (2647fca7) |

16 of the 17 owners are now on the worker; the 17th, `VisitCommunityLot+Definition`, stays on the sim thread through
its G-M5 skip (LynMods override), as on Steam. Install lines: the same 220 OK lines and the same FAIL/SKIP/WARN set as the
parity run (only the known `WARN detour write ... crosses an 8-byte boundary`). Row:
`probe-out/queue/ea169-autshadow-hashes-2026-11-13.jsonl` (harness worktree).
