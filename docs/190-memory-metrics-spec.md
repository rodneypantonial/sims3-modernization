# 190. Memory metrics spec (movable caches)

Goal (Rodney, 2026-10-25): player logs should show the real RAM and address-space cost of every cache we could move out of the process (64-bit helper plus shared-memory windows, docs/08 §5) or cap, so we can pick the first offload from data instead of guesses. Rule: only **movable** data gets sub-categories. Unmovable buckets (GPU-side and DXVK textures, the Mono managed heap, thread stacks, allocator slack, module images, live engine object graphs) get one total line each.

Static research and spec only: no game run, no code. Sources: docs/08, 15, 34, 35, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 52, 53, 54, 57, 58, 66, 119, 130, 187, 188, plus Ghidra headless decompiles for this doc (§8). Steam TS3W.exe 1.67, image base `0x400000`. Tags as in AGENTS.md: `[verified]` = disassembly, decompile or measurement; `[inferred]`; `[community]`.

## 0. Summary

- **37 allocation sites or cache owners** found in the engine, the runtime and our own code (§2). **14 are movable or cappable**, 23 are unmovable.
- **Expected size order of the movable ones** (Rodney's setup, BP; most of these are not measured yet): string-table bucket layouts (~90 MB stock with the store set, up to ~290 MB on big setups [community]; S3PP shrinks it) > routesnap clone stack when P5/P6 are on (~50 MB committed at load, ~200 MB of largest free block after 10-16 min, docs/66 §7) > CAS part cache (unknown, built for every CASP) > CAS/world compositor MRU (unknown) > package indexes (~18.5 MB, 17.6 B per resource) > shader bytecode kept (~12.5 MB) > ResourceCache cold part (~10-20 MB) > catalog (~8 MB fixed + per-product heap) > AnimationCache (3-10 MB, capped at 15) > AsyncLoader reads in flight (cap 20 MB) > transient read/decompress and save buffers (peaks of several MB) > audio binary cache, preloaded resources (unknown).
- **The biggest buckets are unmovable:** ResourceCache in-use resources (~390 MB, live objects hold them, docs/08 Phase 0), the Boehm GC heap (352-360 MB), thread stacks (~140 MB reserved), module images (~426 MB), DXVK mapped texture window (<= 100 MB + other mappings), and ~1 GB of EA-heap engine objects and driver memory with no owner yet (docs/66 §3.3).
- **A key finding for measurement** [verified, §8]: in this release build `EA_AllocTagged 0x4E3F90` drops the allocation tag string and passes only size and flags to `Malloc 0x4E69D0`, and EA's own memory tracker `0x9336F0` is reachable from one hash-table allocation wrapper `0x624590`, only in tracking mode `[0x11DC18C] != 0`. So the engine keeps **no per-owner byte counts**. Per-owner numbers must come from (a) the few owner counters that exist (ResourceCache, AnimationCache, SpeedTree, GC, ours), (b) structure walks, or (c) our own caller-sampled allocation profile (§5.3, opt-in).
- **Logging build:** phase 1 (reads and walks only, no hooks) ~2-4 h + one verify run; phase 2 (access counters with hit/miss and distinct-key sketches) ~3-5 h; phase 3 (opt-in caller-sampled EA-heap profile) ~6-10 h + 2 runs; RE first for 6 items (§7) ~4-8 h static.

## 1. Movable or not: the test

An item is **MOVABLE** when one of these holds:

1. **Narrow key -> bytes access with copy-out:** the game asks by key and copies the answer into its own buffer or into a new object (string lookups, resource reads into a caller buffer). A helper process can hold the data and fill a shared window per request (docs/08 §5 transport).
2. **Decode on access:** the game keeps decoded data only to save a re-decode; the source bytes can be re-read (window) or re-decoded on a miss.
3. **Cappable with eviction:** a budget or an eviction path exists or can be added without changing what the game sees (only time).

**UNMOVABLE**: a live object graph where other code keeps raw pointers into the data (scene, objects, routing world, CAS parts in use), GPU or driver memory, OS memory (images, stacks, file mappings owned by DXVK), the managed heap (Boehm scans it in place, docs/57), allocator metadata and slack.

**Pointer-lifetime verdict** (column in §3): `copies out` = callers keep no pointer into the cache after the call, so a window that is reused per request works; `keeps pointers` = callers hold pointers, so only a cap or a compaction (or a copy-out shim in front of every reader) works.

## 3. Movable sub-categories: how to measure

Cost classes: **R** = plain reads of a few globals/fields on the userdiag memory worker (µs); **W** = structure walk (ms, once per sample or per world load, on the stated thread); **H** = hook with a counter (ns per call); **P** = sampled allocation profile (opt-in, §5.3).

| Id | Sub-category (log key) | How to measure cheaply | Size at load / growth per hour / per CC package (expected) | Access metric to log | Pointer lifetime | Offload / cap path | Owner | Cost |

| M9 | AnimationCache (`anim`) | **R** AnimationCache `+0x94` (priority 1000 entry of the cache array) | 3-10 MB, capped 15 MB [measured] | none | evictable | already capped | us | R |
| M10 | AsyncLoader in flight (`async`) | **R** AsyncLoader `+0x30` (in flight), `+0x34`, `+0x38` (limit), `+0x74`/`+0x78` (loads, bytes); the instance pointer needs RE (§7 Q5) | 0-20 MB transient; bytes/hour = streaming volume | loads and MB per min (deltas of `+0x74`/`+0x78`) | copies out (handed to the factory) | cap = `MemoryUsageLimit` | us | R |
| M11 | Transient read and save buffers (`xfer`) | **H** at `DBPF ReadDecompress 0x4A8380` (sizes are arguments: `fileSize + memSize`): bytes in flight, max single, count >= 4 MB; during a save, the `Save_WritePackage` span (docs/188 §3) gives the save window | peak only; several MB per big texture/mesh [inferred]; more with 2K CC textures | reads/min, MB/min, max single MB, peak in-flight MB | copies out [verified mechanism docs/39] | helper decode into the engine's buffer (docs/08 H1) removes the raw half; save compress is Apex's (FastCacheCompression slot `0xFB901C`) | joint | H ~10 ns + 2 adds |
| M12 | Audio binary cache (`aud`) | **W** core list walk of the `Audio/Allocator` heap object (`+0x448` cores, `+0x48C` direct bytes; heap pointer RE §7 Q6) = whole audio heap; split of the binary cache needs `Audio/ResourceCacheMap` RE | unknown | none for phase 1 | voices keep pointers while playing [inferred] | cap via `BinaryResourceCacheSizeMB` if the game reads it (reader not traced) | us | W ~0.1 ms |
| M13 | Preloaded resources (`pre`) | **W** walk of `ResourceSystem/PreloadedResources` (RE §7 Q5), sum resource sizes (`+0x20` of each resource, as the RC uses [verified §8]) | unknown; flat | none | referenced (they are kept on purpose) | cap: `HoldOntoResources=0` (correct spelling) A/B | us | W once per load |
| M14 | DCCache index (`dcc`) | with M5: size of `dcc.ent` / `missingdeps.idx` files in the header worker (numbers only) | unknown; scales with `.sims3pack` installs | none | copies out [inferred] | with M5 | us | 0 |

Hot-set estimate for each H metric: distinct keys seen in the 10-minute window (sketch) x mean bytes per entry of that cache = hot bytes. A cache whose hot bytes are far below its size is a good window candidate (the window only needs the hot set); one whose hot set is close to its size gains nothing from a window and needs a cap or compaction instead.

## 4. Unmovable totals (one line each)

| Key | Total | How to measure | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `img` | Module images | existing `memory at` field `modules` (`MEM_IMAGE`) [built 0.36.66] | 0 (same walk) |
| `map` | Mapped files (mostly DXVK texture window) | existing `mapped files` field (`MEM_MAPPED`) | 0 |
| `gc` | Boehm heap / free / collections | **R** `[0x12225A0]`, `[0x12225B4]`, `[0x11F2F90]` [verified docs/66 §6.1] | R |
| `stk` | Thread stacks reserved / committed | per-thread TEB `StackBase - DeallocationStack` (as `[ThreadStack]`), or count of allocation bases whose regions carry `PAGE_GUARD` (in the existing walk) [inferred method] | W on the memory worker, ~140 threads |
| `rc` | RC in-use bytes | **R** RC `+0x94` minus cold `+0x98` | R |
| `st` | SpeedTree bytes | **R** `[0x11D8628]` (plain counter; a torn read is a few KB off) [verified docs/34] | R |
| `ea` | EA heap committed / free-in-bins / direct-mapped, per heap (MemoryMan, Audio, others) | **W** core list `+0x448` (committed per core), `+0x488`/`+0x48C` direct blocks; free = top `+0x440` size + bins (walk `+0x28` bins under the heap CS `+0x4E4`; or skip bins and log only top + cores, which needs no lock) [verified layout docs/15] | W: cores ~µs; bins walk ~0.1-1 ms under the allocator lock: phase 3 only |
| `mi` | mimalloc arenas (S3SS) reserved / committed | allocation bases of 64/128 MiB `MEM_PRIVATE` reserves in the existing walk (group regions by `AllocationBase`) [inferred signature] | 0 (same walk) |
| `ours` | Our own heaps other than routesnap | `GetProcessHeaps` + `HeapSummary` (Windows 8+) for heaps we created; process heap separately | W ~µs per heap |
| `rest` | Unattributed private (driver, DXVK private, EAWebkit, unknown EA owners) | `private - (gc + ea + mi + rs + ours + stk)` | 0 |

## 5. Log line format and builder plan

### 5.1 Lines

One `diag: mem` line right after each existing `memory at` line (world load, save start, save end, every 10 min, exit), numbers only: no names, keys, paths or package names. `-` = not readable in this build (RE missing, Apex owns it, or feature off). MB with one decimal for values under 100, integers above. `mov` holds the movable sub-categories, `fix` the unmovable totals.

```
<!-- docs-code: ok -->
diag: mem #3 save-start mov stbl=88.4/3187/7919 rs=48/106/7/1.5 casp=-/7678 comp=- idx=18.5 shd=12.5 rcCold=14.2 cat=8.4 anim=4.1 async=0.0/20 xfer=6.2 aud=- pre=- dcc=0.3 fix img=426 map=145 gc=360/151/812 stk=140/9 rc=388/200/41k st=11.2 ea=1210/96/22 mi=320/210 ours=6 rest=402
```

Field forms: `stbl=MB/tables/buckets-per-table` (bucket count shows S3PP on or off), `rs=committedMB/reservedMB/imagesMB/ringMB`, `casp=MB/parts`, `async=inflightMB/limitMB`, `gc=heapMB/freeMB/collections`, `stk=reservedMB/committedMB`, `rc=inUseMB/budgetMB/entries`, `ea=committedMB/topFreeMB/directMB`, `mi=reservedMB/committedMB`.

Access line every 10 min of play (not at saves), deltas over the window:

```
<!-- docs-code: ok -->
diag: memaccess 10min rc get=48k hit=97.1 miss=1.4k rdMB=212 rdMaxMB=5.3 inflightMaxMB=11.0 stbl get=31k keys=2.9k casp get=4.1k keys=610 comp hit=- miss=-
```

`keys` = distinct keys in the window (sketch estimate, ±3%). Length: ~300-420 characters per line; one line per sample, so a 3-hour session adds ~20 `mem` + ~18 `memaccess` lines.

### 5.2 Builder plan

| Phase | What | Where | Effort | Game runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Reads and walks without hooks: `gc`, `rc` (+ cold, entries), `anim`, `st`, `rs` counters + `HeapSummary`, `ea` cores and direct blocks (no bins), `mi` and `stk` from the existing region walk grouped by allocation base, `idx`/`dcc` computed by the header worker, `rest`. Emits `diag: mem` | userdiag memory worker (`[UserDiag]`, docs/188 §6); RC fields read without the lock (aligned dwords); entry count only under `g_ResourceCacheLock 0xFFDD34` for one read, never a table walk off the sim thread | 2-4 h incl. selftest (line format, sums) | 1 verify (`verify-userdiag.json` + `logRequire` on `diag: mem`) |
| 2 | Access counters: H on `ReadDecompress 0x4A8380` (count, bytes, max, in flight), RC lookups at `0x7324E0` (or its callers, if Apex's ResourceLookupCache shares bytes; check `node tools/hook-sites.ts --check`), `CASCache_GetCachedPart 0x5A44A0`, the script-side string lookup caller; one 1 KB HyperLogLog per category (key hash: RC/resource key 16 B, STBL key 64-bit, CAS instance); `async` once the instance is found. Emits `diag: memaccess` | new `memdiag.cpp` (counters in a new counter version: reserve in docs/registry.md first) | 3-5 h | 1 verify + 1 BP 10 min to measure the counters' own cost |
| RE | §7 Q1-Q6 (STBL layout, CAS part cache, compositor MRU, shader sizes, AsyncLoader/Preloader instances, audio heap pointer) | Ghidra headless, static | 4-8 h | 0 |
| 3 | Opt-in caller-sampled EA heap profile `[MemProfile] Enabled=0` (§5.3): splits `ea` and `rest` by subsystem, sizes the owners no walk reaches (CAS cache, catalog heap, Mono eglib, world, UI) | detour of EA `Malloc 0x4E69D0` / `Free 0x4E5920` / `Realloc 0x4E6A70` | 6-10 h | 2 (BP soak 30 min + crash-free save matrix sample) |

### 5.3 Phase 3: caller-sampled profile (opt-in)

- Sampling by address: on Malloc, keep the block only when `hash(ptr) & 63 == 0`; store `{ptr, bucket, size}` in a fixed 64K-entry open-addressing table (~1 MB, own `VirtualAlloc`). On Free, the same hash test decides the lookup, so 63 of 64 frees cost one multiply and a compare. Live bytes per bucket = sampled bytes x 64 (good above ~1 MB per bucket; error ~1/sqrt(samples)) [inferred statistics].
- Bucket = the first return address outside the allocator wrappers (`0x4E3F90`, `0x931020` vtable slots, eglib `0xD70A10`/`0xD70A30`, EASTL helpers) mapped to an owner range table (resource `0x4A0000-0x4B3000` + `0x727000-0x739000`, CAS `0x5A2C00-0x5F1700`, renderer `0x5F0000-0x730000`, SpeedTree, audio `0x860000-0x8C5000`, Mono `0xD70000-0xEC0000`, world `0xC20000-0xCA0000`, objects `0x930000-0x93B000`, UI `0x500000-0x520000`, ...; ranges from docs/32 and the docs above, finalised in the build). `RtlCaptureStackBackTrace` depth 4 only for the sampled 1/64.
- Cost [inferred]: the allocator runs ~6.9% of sim-thread samples (docs/15); one hash test per call is ~1-3 ns, the sampled path ~0.5-1 µs, so ~1-3 ms/s summed over threads. Opt-in, for heavy-CC bug reports and our own soaks, never default.
- Conflicts: Apex FastMemory changes timing around `0x4E5306`, `0x4E4E81`/`0x4E504C` and the trim `0x4E4F90`, and our own `[Alloc]` uses the same four entries (docs/187 row 12, not in ApexStandDown). Rule: `[MemProfile]` stands down when another module already patched the entry bytes (same check as `[ThreadStack]`), and never runs with `[Alloc] Enabled=1`.

### 5.4 Risks

- **Torn or stale reads**: phase 1 reads dwords the sim thread writes; sums can be a few KB off; no pointer chasing off the sim thread except the RC cache array (stable after init [inferred]). Walks of mutable lists (STBL, CAS cache, catalog) run on the sim thread at world load only.
- **Lock order**: taking `g_ResourceCacheLock` from the memory worker is safe only for a single read with nothing else held; never take an EA heap CS from our worker in phase 1-2.
- **Hook overlap**: S3PP detours `0x59C5B0`, Apex owns `0x4AFFC0`/`0x4B2D00`/`0x4B1AE0` families and the compression slot; S3SS replaces the RefPack core `0x4EB3B0` (we hook above it at `0x4A8380`, docs/08 H1). Run `tools/hook-sites.ts --check` before phase 2.
- **Privacy**: counts and sizes only; key hashes stay in memory inside the sketch and are never written.
- **Cost creep**: the 10-min cadence and the worker thread keep phase 1-2 off the sim thread except the world-load walks (~ms once per load).

## 6. Decision table: what player data picks the first offload

Collect phase 1-2 lines from at least 10 player logs with heavy setups (>= 2 GB in `Mods\Packages` per the header, or a session low under 600 MB largest free), plus our own BP/IP/SV soaks. Regress each `mov` value against the header's package count, CASP/STBL counts and play time.

| If the logs show | Then build first | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `stbl` > 60 MB and bucket count 7,919 (S3PP layout off) | own STBL layout cap (or recommend S3PP `StblBucketLayoutTuning`) | biggest known movable, copy-out access, zero helper |
| `rs` drop in largest free block > 100 MB with P5/P6 on and session low < 600 MB | routesnap S1 + S2 (docs/66 §7) | ours, low risk, ~70-90 MB |
| `casp` > 40 MB and its slope per 1,000 CC CASPs > 5 MB | CAS part cache compaction, then helper with copy-out shim | grows with CC, built once, never evicted |
| `comp` > 50 MB and `memaccess` compositor misses low | cap the in-memory compositor MRU | misses already served from disk |
| `rest` > 600 MB or `ea` growing > 100 MB/hour | phase 3 profile on that setup before any offload | unknown owner; sizing first |
| `xfer` peak > 32 MB or largest free at save start < 300 MB with high `rdMaxMB` | docs/08 H1 read helper (raw buffer out of process); save buffers with Apex | transient peaks hit fragmented space first |
| `idx` > 100 MB | key -> database helper with Apex | only then worth the transport |
| `gc` free > 100 MB at every sample | `InitialHeapMB` down (docs/66 #1) | not an offload, but the cheapest MB |
| everything movable < 100 MB summed and Error 12 still reported | caps are not the answer: unmovable owners (stacks, mimalloc arenas, DXVK window) | docs/66 #2-#4 |

## 7. Open RE questions (needed before the item can be measured)

| Q | Question | Blocks | Static effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | STBL resource object layout: bucket array, bucket and entry sizes (and S3PP's rewritten layout) | M1 | ~1 h |
| Q2 | CAS part cache container at `[0x11CE404]` (or the service object): part count field, per-part record size, owned strings/presets | M3 | ~1-2 h |
| Q3 | CAS/CompositorCache MRU (`0x5BB6A0`-`0x5BC6D0`): list head, entry layout, byte counter if any; lookup site for hit/miss | M4 | ~1-2 h |
| Q4 | Where ShaderDB keeps bytecode size per shader after create | M6 | ~0.5 h |
| Q5 | AsyncLoader and Preloader instance pointers (`0x7274D0` init, `0x731AE0`); PreloadedResources list layout | M10, M13 | ~1 h |
| Q6 | Every GeneralAllocator heap object (callers of the heap init, `Audio/Allocator` `0x89F4E0`), so `ea` is per heap; who reads `BinaryResourceCacheSizeMB` | M12, `ea` | ~1 h |
| Q7 | Whether `mono_image_open_from_data` at `0xD6FCB0` copies the S3SA bytes (need_copy) and frees the resource buffer | sizing Mono images inside `rest` | ~0.5 h |
| Q8 | RC hash node layout (bucket array `+0x20`, count `+0x24`, node `+0x10` = resource [verified §8]; next-pointer offset) for an optional per-type split on the sim thread | optional rc split | ~0.5 h |

## 8. Verification done for this doc (Ghidra headless, 2026-10-25)

- `EA_AllocTagged 0x4E3F90` forwards size and flags to `Malloc 0x4E69D0` and does not keep or pass the tag string [verified decompile]. `0x4E69D0` = enter heap CS `+0x4E4`, core `0x4E5E40`, leave [verified, matches docs/15].
- The EA tracker `0x9336F0` (takes lock `0x1042634`, behaviour by mode `[0x11DC18C]` 1 or 2) is called from `0x624590` only when the mode is non-zero; the mode is written only by `IC_GameUtils_SetMemoryTrackingMode 0xEC1520` (values 0-2) [verified decompile; docs/120 found the same]. Turning it on is a debug path with a lock on every tracked allocation: not a player metric.
- `ResourceCache_Add 0x732A00` / `_Find 0x7324E0`: hash table with bucket array `+0x20` and count `+0x24`, node `+0x10` = resource, resource key at `+0x08`, resource size at `+0x20`, held bytes `+0x94` reduced by that size [verified decompile].
- `CASCache_GetCachedPart 0x5A44A0` reads `[0x11CE404]` three times [verified]; that it is the cache container is [inferred] (Q2).
