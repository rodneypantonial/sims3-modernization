# 120. Second Mono thread (M5): what the GC and runtime need, verified statically

Static check of what a second OS thread running managed code (Mono plan M5, docs/118; offline host M1, docs/119) needs from the Boehm GC and the embedded Mono 1.2.3 runtime. It takes the design assumptions of docs/30 (`[MonoThread]` P1-P4 and the worker entry, §5) and the maps in docs/29, docs/56, docs/57 and docs/58, re-checks the ones the design depends on, and adds what they missed. Ghidra headless on a copy project (`game-copy/ghidra-m120`, copied from `ghidra-monob`, symbols already imported), scratch scripts (import census, string scan, instruction dumps, reference lists), plus a PE parse of `game-copy/bin/TS3W.exe` for the TLS directory and the internal-call tables. Steam `TS3W.exe` 1.67, image base `0x400000`. The game was not run. No decompiled code is kept here.

Tags: **[verified]** = read in the disassembly, the reference manager, the PE file or the decompiled class library for this note; **[verified, docs/N]** = verified there and not re-read; **[community-reported]** = stock Boehm 7.x / Mono 1.2 behaviour, not checked in this exe; **[inferred]** = reasoning, with the check that would settle it.

## Summary

- **Collector:** Boehm GC 7.x (7.1 by the code shape, docs/57), Win32 build with the thread table and stop-the-world kept, `LOCK()` compiled out, incremental mode on `GetWriteWatch`, no parallel marker, finalizers on demand. No version string is in the exe; the env-var set in `GC_init` (`GC_PAUSE_TIME_TARGET`, `GC_ENABLE_INCREMENTAL`, `GC_LARGE_ALLOC_WARN_INTERVAL`, no `GC_NPROCS`/`GC_MARKERS`) fits 7.0/7.1 without `PARALLEL_MARK` [verified strings, version inferred].
- **Roots (verified, three sources only):** (1) static data = every committed, writable (`PAGE_READWRITE` or `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE`) **`MEM_IMAGE`** region of every loaded module, re-registered at the start of each root push (`GC_register_dynamic_libraries` `0xE4A8E0` from `GC_push_roots` `0xE4D91E`); (2) the collector's own seven registers (`0xE4BA10`) and its own stack (`0xD71820` through the hook `[0x11949CC]`); (3) the finalizer and disappearing-link tables, the free-list mark bits and the explicit roots of `GC_add_roots`. **`MEM_PRIVATE` memory is never a root**, so another thread's stack is not scanned by accident: docs/29's "GC scans one stack" holds. A thread table exists (`GC_new_thread` `0xE51070`) but has one caller, `GC_thr_init`; no `GC_register_my_thread`, `DllMain` attach or `mono_thread_attach` [verified].
- **Stop-the-world is real** (`SuspendThread`/`ResumeThread` on every registered thread except the caller, under `GC_write_cs` `0x1222580`), and the duplicated thread handle has full access (`DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS`), so P2's `GetThreadContext` on it works [verified]. **The allocation lock is a no-op** (`GC_allocate_ml` `0x1234320` initialised, never entered) [verified, docs/57].
- **Interpreter per-thread state:** the two frame globals `[0x11F4170]`/`[0x11F416C]` are still the only interpreter globals (5 references each, the docs/30 P4 table) [re-verified]. Everything else is already per thread: six Mono TLS keys, the managed exception path (`setjmp3` in `0xE5A3CE`, `longjmp` from `0xE537B2` and `0xE5A52C` through the thread's `ThreadContext` in TLS `[0x11F4160]`), and no `__declspec(thread)` data in use (`.tls` holds 8 zero bytes; its index variable `[0x1220AD0]` has no code reference) [verified].
- **Two new findings that change the design:**
  1. **`GC_add_current_malloc_heap` `0xE4EC40` calls CRT `malloc`/`free` from inside the root push**, once per GC number, and the root push runs with the world stopped (docs/30 §12.6). With a second registered thread suspended while it holds the CRT heap lock, the collector deadlocks. Its only caller is `GC_is_heap_base` `0xE4EDA0`, whose answer cannot change the outcome here (only `MEM_IMAGE` regions pass the filter, and a malloc heap is never an image) [verified filter order; dead-filter claim inferred]. **Fix: patch `0xE4EC40` to `ret`** (one byte, P3 install). **Update 2026-10-20 (§2.2.1):** the function never runs on Windows NT in this build (both `GC_is_heap_base` callers are switched off), so the hazard is not real and the patch is a no-op guard [verified static; I-120-2 refuted, I-120-3 verified].
  2. **`Monitor` is a no-op in this build** [verified]: the `System.Threading.Monitor` internal calls point at three EA stubs (`ret`, `mov eax,1; ret`, `xor eax,eax; ret`), and EA's `mscorlib` `Monitor.Enter`/`Exit` only check for null. So C# `lock` gives **no** exclusion on any thread, and `Thread.Start`'s `Thread_internal` is a `return 0` stub. Managed code cannot synchronise the worker with the sim thread; the hand-off must be native (docs/30 §7 already is) or `Interlocked.*`, which is real.
- **Open point resolved (docs/57):** the EA memory tracker `0x9336F0` that heap growth may call takes an EA lock (`Lock_Acquire` `0x4E16F0`). It is called only when the tracking mode `[0x11DC18C]` (set by the script IC `GameUtils.SetMemoryTrackingMode` `0xEC1520`) is non-zero, so the rule is: worker off unless the mode is 0.
- **docs/30 verdicts:** P1 holds; P2 holds; P3 needs change (17 lock detours confirmed, plus the `0xE4B3F0` replacement, **plus the `0xE4EC40` patch**: 19 sites); P4 holds; worker entry §5 holds with two new rules (no managed locking, tracking mode 0). **No blocker found.** Still open and needed before a live run: which thread is in Boehm's table today (docs/29 §4.3; one load with the built v18 counters answers it).
- **Go/no-go:** **go** for the first offline proof (docs/119 host, then docs/30 Mode=1/2 in an emulated or offline harness) and for building P3/P4. About 9-14 h of agent build and selftest, then 1 load for the registration check and 3 clean-night runs for Mode 0/1/2 (§6).

## 1. The collector and how it finds roots

### 1.1 Build and configuration [verified unless tagged]

| Item | Finding |
|---|---|
| Family | Boehm GC, Win32 (`os_dep.c`/`win32_threads.c` code and strings: `"Weird VirtualQuery result"`, `"Failed to find stack base in GC_new_thread"`, `"too many threads"`, `"GC_stop_world() called before GC_thr_init()"`) |
| Version | 7.x; no version string. `GC_init` reads `GC_PRINT_STATS`, `GC_DUMP_REGULARLY`, `GC_FIND_LEAK`, `GC_ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS`, `GC_DONT_GC`, `GC_PRINT_BACK_HEIGHT`, `GC_NO_BLACKLIST_WARNING`, `GC_PAUSE_TIME_TARGET`, `GC_LARGE_ALLOC_WARN_INTERVAL`, `GC_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE`, `GC_MAXIMUM_HEAP_SIZE`, `GC_ENABLE_INCREMENTAL` (strings `0x108DCB4`-`0x108DEFC`). 7.1 [inferred from this set and the code shape, as docs/57] |
| Threads | `GC_WIN32_THREADS`-style explicit table (256 x 0x14 at `0x1221000`), not `GC_DLL`/`DllMain` registration; only `GC_thr_init` `0xE513D0` registers, and it registers the `GC_init` thread [verified, docs/29 §3.1, re-read: `GC_new_thread` has one caller] |
| Parallel mark / thread-local alloc | absent: no marker threads (the exe's `CreateThread`/`_beginthreadex` callers are EA and CRT code outside the Boehm block), no per-thread free lists [verified import census] |
| Allocation lock | compiled out; `GC_allocate_ml` never entered [verified, docs/57 §2] |
| Incremental | `GetWriteWatch` dirty bits (`GC_gww_dirty_init` `0xE4EFB0` is the one `GetWriteWatch` caller); no write barrier [verified here and docs/57 §6] |
| Finalizers | on demand: `GC_finalize_on_demand` = 1, notifier NULL; run only from `mono_gc_invoke_finalizers` `0xE697F0` on the sim thread [verified, docs/30 §12.3] |
| `GC_no_win32_dlls` `[0x11F40E4]` | set only by `GC_check_win32` `0xE4EB70` (two `or` sites); read by `GC_init`, `GC_enable_incremental` and the two root-registration functions below. 0 on NT [inferred from Boehm: it is set for Win32s/Win9x], so the dynamic-library path runs (to confirm live: I-120-5) |

### 1.2 Root sources [verified]

`GC_push_roots` `0xE4D910` (docs/57 §4) does, in order:

1. **`GC_register_dynamic_libraries` `0xE4A8E0`** (call at `0xE4D91E`). When `[0x11F40E4]` is 0 it walks the address space from `[0x1222548]` to `[0x122254C]` with `VirtualQuery` and registers a region when `State == MEM_COMMIT` (`0x1000`), `Protect` is `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` (`0x40`) or `PAGE_READWRITE` (`0x4`), `GC_is_heap_base` `0xE4EDA0` says no, and **`Type == MEM_IMAGE` (`0x1000000`, compare at `0xE4A956`)**. Registration goes through `GC_cond_add_roots` `0xE4A870`, which cuts out registered thread stacks (`GC_get_next_stack` `0xE51360`) before `GC_add_roots_inner` `0xE4D5F0`. The other branch, `GC_register_root_section` `0xE4EE10` (only when `[0x11F40E4]` is set, from `GC_init` via `0xE4EEE0`), registers the exe image's writable sections and accepts `PAGE_WRITECOPY` variants too. Either way the static roots are **writable image sections only**: the exe's `.data`/`.tls`, every DLL's data, and every ASI's data (ts3native included).
2. Free-list mark bits, finalizer and disappearing-link tables (`0xE4A9A0`), explicit roots (`GC_add_roots`: Mono domain, `mono_gc_init`, the interpreter runtime-method hash; docs/57 §3.3). Host roots: `GC_malloc_uncollectable` blocks (call records, arena list nodes; docs/57 §1) are roots by kind.
3. The collector's registers: `0xE4BA10` pushes EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESI, EDI with `GC_push_one` `0xE4D520` (only caller `GC_push_roots`).
4. The tail jump through `[0x11949CC]` -> `0xE4EF90` -> `0xE51350` -> `0xD71820`: the collector's own stack only (docs/30 §13).

Consequences for M5:

- **No accidental scan of another stack** [verified]: thread stacks are `MEM_PRIVATE`, so step 1 never adds them. Without P2, a worker's stack and registers are invisible to a sim-thread collection, as docs/29 said.
- **Where a hand-off may keep managed references** [inferred from the filter]: in a managed static (docs/30 §7 does this), in a ts3native global (`.data` is `MEM_IMAGE` and writable, so it is a root once the dynamic-library pass runs), on a registered thread's stack (P2), or in a `GC_malloc_uncollectable` block. **Not** in `malloc`/`new`/`VirtualAlloc` memory or a TLS slot (TLS is not a root, docs/57 §4).
- Root registration happens again at each root push, including stopped marks, which is where finding 1 of the summary comes from (§2.2).

## 2. Stop-the-world, suspension and what the collector calls while threads are stopped

### 2.1 Suspension [verified]

- `GC_stop_world` `0xE511A0` (only caller `GC_stopped_mark` `0xE49980`): `EnterCriticalSection(GC_write_cs)`, then for every in-use entry whose thread id differs from `GetCurrentThreadId()`: `GetExitCodeThread` (dead thread: free the entry) or `SuspendThread` (`[0xF95154]`, only caller `0xE511E1`) and `+0x10 = 1`. `GC_start_world` `0xE51290` resumes with `ResumeThread` (`[0xF95150]`, `0xE512AF`). Both imports have no other caller in the exe.
- `GC_new_thread` duplicates `GetCurrentThread()` with `DuplicateHandle(..., access 0, inherit 0, DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS)` (`push 2` at `0xE510F3`, call `0xE51111`), so the table handle carries the thread's full access, `THREAD_GET_CONTEXT` and `THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME` included. P2's `GetThreadContext` on it is legal. The exe does not import `GetThreadContext`; ts3native imports it (built in step 1).
- So docs/29's "assumes single-threaded" is wrong for suspension and right for everything else: the collector stops registered threads but scans only its own stack and takes no allocation lock.

### 2.2 Calls made while the world is stopped [verified sites; deadlock reading inferred]

A stopped mark runs root pushes (docs/30 §12.6) and may grow the mark stack. While it runs, every other registered thread is suspended wherever it was. Any lock the collector takes that a suspended thread may hold is a deadlock. Calls found on these paths:

| Call | Site | Lock | When | M5 action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CRT `malloc(8)`, `malloc(10000..500000)` loop, `free` | `GC_add_current_malloc_heap` `0xE4EC40` (`0xE4EC47`, `0xE4ECB1`, `0xE4ECE9`, `0xE4ED1D`, `0xE4ED4F`), from `GC_is_heap_base` `0xE4EDA0` (`0xE4EDAD`, only caller), from `0xE4A8E0`/`0xE4EE10` | `MSVCR80` heap lock (or the allocator S3SS/mimalloc substitutes) | the first root push of each GC number (`[0x11949C8] != GC_gc_no`) | **patch `0xE4EC40` to `ret`** (§4 P3) |
| `GC_win32_get_mem` `0xD70900` -> EA tracker `0x9336F0` (`Lock_Acquire` `0x4E16F0` at `0x93376F`, `Lock_Release` at `0x933A47`) | `0xD70928`-`0xD7097D`, only when `[0x11DC18C] != 0` and `0x931080` agrees | EA tracker lock, also taken by `IndexBuffer_CreateD3D` `0x616C40` (render) | heap growth, including mark-stack growth `0xE4C950` from `GC_mark_some` (`0xE4D3A3`, `0xE4D3FF`) | **rule: the worker runs only while `[0x11DC18C] == 0`.** Its only writer is `IC_GameUtils_SetMemoryTrackingMode` `0xEC152E` (a debug IC) [verified] |
| `VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualQuery`, `GetWriteWatch`/`ResetWriteWatch` | heap growth, root registration, dirty bits | none in user mode [community-reported] | each cycle | none |
| Warn proc `[0x11949C0]` (set by Mono init via `GC_set_warn_proc` `0xE4DFC0`) | `GC_finalize` `0xE4B021` ("Finalization cycle"), `GC_collect_or_expand` (out of memory), large-block warnings | Mono logging, may allocate through the EA arena `0x4E69D0` [inferred] | rare error paths | accept; count in Verify |
| `GC_write_cs` | `GC_stop_world`, `GC_write` `0xE4DD50` | Boehm's own | log output with `GC_PRINT_STATS` only | none |

`0xE4EC40` is the one that matters: it runs every collection, and the CRT heap lock is the lock a suspended game thread is most likely to hold. Why `ret` is safe: `GC_is_heap_base` exists to keep malloc heaps out of the root set, but EA's dynamic-library filter only accepts `MEM_IMAGE` regions, and `GC_register_root_section` only walks the exe image, so a "yes, malloc heap" answer can never change which region is registered [verified 2026-10-20, §2.2.1; was inferred, I-120-3]. The list it maintains, `[0x11F40E8]`, is used by `0xE4EC10`, `0xE4EC40` and `0xE4EDA0` (raw byte scan of `.text` for the address; one more match at `0xA241AB` is outside the GC block and was not decoded).

Today's game has the same hazard if the main thread is the registered `GC_init` thread (docs/29 §4.3): every sim-thread stopped mark would then suspend the main thread and may `malloc` while it holds the heap lock. That this does not visibly freeze the game hints that only one thread is registered today, or that the timing is rare [inferred; I-120-1 settles which thread is registered].

#### 2.2.1 Re-read of the filter and of the callers (2026-10-20, static)

Source: raw disassembly of the Steam 1.67 exe (capstone over the PE file), no Ghidra project needed.

| Step | Site | What it does | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Filter order in `GC_register_dynamic_libraries` `0xE4A8E0` | `0xE4A926` state = `MEM_COMMIT`; `0xE4A93B`/`0xE4A940` protect = `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` or `PAGE_READWRITE`; `0xE4A94A` `GC_is_heap_base(AllocationBase)` != 0 rejects; `0xE4A956` type = `MEM_IMAGE` | the heap-base test sits before the image test, and a CRT heap is `MEM_PRIVATE`, so a region it would reject is rejected by the type test anyway | verified |
| What `GC_is_heap_base` `0xE4EDA0` answers without the malloc list | `0xE4EDEB`-`0xE4EE05`: the collector's own heap sections (`0x122EF14`, count `[0x11F40EC]`) | the `ret` only empties the malloc list `[0x11F40E8]`; collector sections still answer yes | verified |
| Caller 1 `0xE4A8E0` | called only from `GC_push_roots` `0xE4D91E`, skipped while `GC_no_dls` `[0x11949A8]` != 0 (`0xE4D915`); `mono_gc_base_init` sets it to 1 at `0xE69598` (I-119-37) | does not run | verified |
| Caller 2 `0xE4EE10` (registers every committed RW region that is not a heap base, no type test) | called only from `0xE4EEE0` (`GC_init`, `0xE4E2D7`); returns at once unless `GC_no_win32_dlls` `[0x11F40E4]` != 0. Its one writer, `0xE4EB70`, sets it only when `GetVersion` has the high bit set and major version <= 3 (Win32s) | does not run on NT | verified |

So on Windows 10/11 `GC_add_current_malloc_heap` is never called: the stopped-world `malloc` hazard of this section does not exist, and the P3 `ret` is a guard against a future `GC_no_dls = 0`, not a fix. The `ret` stays (one byte, already built). I-120-2 refuted, I-120-3 verified.

## 3. Interpreter and runtime state for a second thread

### 3.1 Per-thread already [verified]

| State | Mechanism | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Interpreter `ThreadContext` | TLS `[0x11F4160]` (`mono_interp_init` `0xE5A6A3`) | get/set sites in docs/56 §1; `0xE5A600` keeps it on the stack and clears the slot on exit (docs/57 §4) |
| Managed exceptions | the throw path `0xE53740` reads the context from TLS `[0x11F4160]` (`0xE53748`), stores the exception through `ctx+0xC` and `longjmp`s to the buffer at `ctx+0x10` (`0xE537B2`); `interp_mono_invoke_with_state` sets that buffer with `setjmp3` (`0xE5A3CE`) and has its own `longjmp` at `0xE5A52C` | so an exception on the worker unwinds the worker's own stack only; `longjmp` has no other Mono caller |
| Current domain, loader error, marshal type-info marker, P/Invoke last error, current `MonoThread` (always NULL) | TLS keys `[0x11959DC]`, `[0x1220F38]`, `[0x11F43C4]`, `[0x11F43E0]`, `[0x1195B7C]` | `TlsAlloc` callers `0xE5A680`, `0xE75BF0`, `0xE84880`, `0xE99CB0` (two keys), `0xEBB180`: six keys, matches docs/56 §1 |
| SEH | `fs:[0]` frames in the mark code | per thread by definition (docs/56) |
| Static TLS (`__declspec(thread)`) | `.tls` section 8 bytes, all zero; TLS directory index variable `[0x1220AD0]` has no reference in code | unused, nothing to move [verified PE + references] |

### 3.2 Global, must become per thread [verified]

Only P4's two globals. References re-read: `[0x11F4170]` at `0xE53EBD` (read), `0xE53ED7`, `0xE597BA`, `0xE5986C` (writes), `0xE534EA` (read in `0xE534E0`); `[0x11F416C]` at `0xE53EC2` (read), `0xE53EDD`, `0xE597BF`, `0xE59866` (writes), `0xE534E0` (read). Same nine sites as the docs/30 §4 table, nothing new. docs/56's other per-call globals (`host+0xBC8/+0xBD0/+0xBD4`, the call-record list `[0x11EE5A4]`, the IC nesting counter `[0x11F2D84]`) are host state that a worker avoids by entering only through `0xE5A600` and calling no EA internal call (docs/30 §5, docs/56 §2); they are rules, not patches.

### 3.3 Shared runtime state a worker would race

| Area | State in this build | M5 treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Class, method, name, generic, array caches; vtables; class init; transform; interned strings (`ldstr_section` `0x11F45A0`; `String.Intern`/`IsInterned` icalls `0xEB93B0`/`0xEB93C0`) | locked (loader lock `0x11F43A8`, per-domain lock, `0x11F4574`, `0x11F4174`) [verified, docs/58] | warm-up on the sim thread (docs/30 §5 step 6); the worker then reads published pointers |
| GCHandle table `0x11959E0`; thunk hash `0x11F4128`; reflection hash `0x11F46F0` | no lock [verified, docs/58] | rules: no GCHandle/weak refs, warm every internal call once, no reflection |
| Native-call trampolines (no JIT) | `tramp_create_thunk` `0xE51400` fills `[0x11F4128]` on the first call of a signature and caches it at `RuntimeMethod+0x10` [verified, docs/58] | warm-up |
| **`Monitor` (C# `lock`, `Monitor.Wait/Pulse`)** | **no-op.** Internal-call table: `Monitor_exit`, `Monitor_pulse`, `Monitor_pulse_all` -> `0xC0FD60` (`ret`); `Monitor_test_owner`, `Monitor_wait` -> `0x619EF0` (`mov eax,1; ret`); `Monitor_test_synchronised`, `Monitor_try_enter` -> `0x5BFB90` (`xor eax,eax; ret`). EA's `mscorlib` `Monitor.Enter`/`Exit` bodies are a null check only [verified: PE tables, anchored on `SuppressFinalize` -> `0xE786F0` (docs/57) and cross-checked on `Interlocked.Increment(int&)` -> `0xE66E10`, an `InterlockedIncrement` caller; decompiled `mscorlib` `System.Threading/Monitor.cs`] | **new rule:** no managed synchronisation between threads. Everything the worker shares is handed over natively (docs/30 §7 already does) or with `Interlocked.*` |
| `Interlocked.*` | real: `CompareExchange` `0xEBA2B0` (calls `InterlockedCompareExchange`), `Exchange` `0xEBA1F0`, `Increment(int&)` `0xE66E10`, `Decrement(int&)` `0xF4F560` (`InterlockedDecrement`), 64-bit variants `0xEBA340`/`0xEBA190`/`0xEBA1C0` [verified table; bodies of the 64-bit ones not read] | allowed on the worker |
| Managed threads | `Thread_internal` (thread start) -> `0x5BFB90` (`return 0`); `CurrentThread_internal` -> `0xEB9F40` (`TlsGetValue([0x1195B7C])`, NULL) [verified] | managed code cannot start a thread; the worker is a native thread (docs/30 §5) |
| `mscorlib` lazy statics guarded by `lock` (comparers, encodings, culture data) | the `lock` does nothing (row above), so a first use on two threads at once races [inferred from the Monitor finding] | warm-up must touch every `mscorlib` type the worker uses (`EqualityComparer<T>.Default`, `Dictionary`, `List`, string concat) on the sim thread first |
| `mono_stats` counters | unlocked `add` [verified, docs/56] | accept (lost counts only) |

#### 3.3.1 Who uses `Monitor` (2026-10-20, static, I-120-6)

Source: the call index (`game-copy/analysis/callgraph/index.json`, all edge kinds) and the `MethodDef` impl flags of the ten extracted assemblies. Nothing was run.

| Assembly group | Callers of `System.Threading.Monitor` | `Wait`/`Pulse`/`PulseAll`/`TryEnter` | `Synchronized` methods |
|---|---|---|---|
| Game scripts (ScriptCore, SimIFace, Sims3GameplayObjects, Sims3GameplaySystems, Sims3Metadata, Sims3StoreObjects, UI) | **0** | 0 | 1,174, all event `add_`/`remove_` accessors (UI 584, Sims3GameplaySystems 448, SimIFace 92, ScriptCore 28, Sims3GameplayObjects 20, Sims3Metadata 2) |
| `mscorlib` | 182 (`lock` = `Enter`/`Exit`) | only `Monitor`'s own overloads calling each other | 36, all event accessors |
| `System`, `System.Xml` | 3, 4 | 0 | 0, 24 (event accessors) |

Verdict [verified for the shipped scripts]: no game script calls `Monitor` or uses `lock`, and nothing anywhere waits or pulses. The only implicit locking is the compiler-made `Synchronized` flag on field-like event accessors, which guards a delegate field during subscribe/unsubscribe; with `Monitor` a no-op it already gives no exclusion today, and the worker subscribes to nothing (docs/30 §5 rules). The `mscorlib` `lock` users are the lazy statics of the row above: warm-up, as already planned. Mods were not scanned; a mod that relies on `lock` across threads is already broken in this build, and the docs/122 allow-list (by assembly MVID) keeps mod code off the worker.

## 4. docs/30 design elements: verdicts and site list

| Element | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** register the worker (and the sim thread if missing) with `GC_new_thread` `0xE51070` under the GC lock | **holds** | one caller today, no lock inside, table entry layout and the `[0x11F4120]` wait as docs/30 §1; the duplicated handle has full access (§2.1). Open: which thread is registered today (I-120-1) |
| **P2** replace `[0x11949CC]` with a push of every suspended thread's registers and stack | **holds** | roots are image data + collector stack only, no `MEM_PRIVATE` (§1.2); the hook is the last step of every root push, including stopped marks; built in ts3native 0.10.4 (docs/30 §13) |
| **P3** gated, re-entrant GC lock | **needs change (one site)** | the 17 detours of docs/57 §7 stand (no new allocation or free-list writer found: the four entries, `GC_free`, the arena trio, the collection entries, finalizer/link registration, `GC_add_roots`); **add the `0xE4EC40` `ret` patch** (§2.2), applied at install with the first 4 bytes checked (`83 EC 20 53`, `sub esp,0x20` / `push ebx`) [verified bytes] |
| **P4** frame globals to TLS | **holds** | same nine sites, no other reference (§3.2) |
| **§5** worker entry through `0xE5A600` with domain TLS, no thread attach | **holds, two rules added** | exceptions unwind per thread (§3.1); add "no managed locking" (§3.3) and "worker only while `[0x11DC18C] == 0`" (§2.2) |
| Finalizers on the sim thread, `0xE4B3F0` replaced | **holds** | unchanged (docs/30 §12.3, docs/57 §5) |

**Site count for P3:** 17 lock detours (`0xE4BE30`, `0xE4BDC0`, `0xE4BF90`, `0xE50DE0`, `0xE4BCE0`, `0xE4A050`, `0xE4A0B0`, `0xE4E450`, `0xE4AAC0`, `0xE4ABE0`, `0xE4AE30`, `0xE4A3F0`, `0xE4BEB0`, `0xD71900`, `0xD71A20`, `0xD71B70`, `0xE4D9F0`) + the `0xE4B3F0` replacement + the `0xE4EC40` patch = **19 sites**. Optional as before: `GC_disable`/`GC_enable` `0xE4DFE0`/`0xE4DFD0`, `GC_make_descriptor` `0xE50F90` (docs/56; or warm-up), a lock around Mono's GC handle functions (docs/58). docs/57's "17 detours" stays correct for the lock; the total patch list grows by one.

## 5. Risks

1. **An unlisted lock taken while the world is stopped** (§2.2 lists what was found by direct calls; indirect calls from the mark code, such as the mark procs `0x12225E8`, were not followed). Mitigation: Mode=2 stress with Verify, a watchdog in ts3native that logs if a stopped world lasts more than ~1 s, crash triage per docs/30 §9.
2. **mscorlib first-use races** with a no-op `lock` (§3.3). Mitigation: warm-up list per worker method, Verify counters on the loader lock and vtable creation (docs/58 §4) by thread.
3. **The registered-thread set today** (I-120-1). If the main thread is in the table, P1 adds the sim thread and every stopped mark then suspends two threads, and the `0xE4EC40` patch also removes a hazard that exists today.
4. **Incremental steps with two mutators**: dirty bits are process-wide (write watch), and every cycle ends in a stopped mark that rescans all roots (docs/30 §12.6); not tested with two threads in this game [community-reported for stock Boehm].
5. **Value**: the first proof moves no game work off the sim thread; it proves the mechanism (docs/30 §10.6).

## 6. Effort and go/no-go

| Step | Work | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| a | P3: 17 detours, `0xE4B3F0` replacement, `0xE4EC40` patch, lock flag in `MtTick`, worker registration/unregister, counters, selftest (two threads on fake free lists and arena) | 3-5 h |
| b | P4: three block stubs and the `0xE534E0` replacement, selftest on copied bytes | 2-3 h |
| c | Worker entry (§5), `MtProbe` in ts3fixes with warm-up, `mtprobe` switch, Verify, rules check (`[0x11DC18C]`, Monitor-free probe code), registry row | 3-4 h |
| d | Offline proof in the docs/119 host or the emulator harness (docs/63): run `MtProbe` on two threads with a forced collection while the other thread is inside the interpreter | 1-2 h |
| | **Agent build total** | **~9-14 h** |
| live | One load with `[MonoThread] Enabled=1 Mode=0` (registration check, I-120-1); then clean nights: Mode=0 cost A/B, Mode=1 Verify, Mode=2 Verify on BP/SV/IP | 1 load + 3 clean-night runs |

**Go** for a), b), c) and the offline proof d): every static question docs/30 left has an answer, and none is a blocker. **Before any live Mode=1 run:** I-120-1 (one load) and the `0xE4EC40` patch in the build. The Mono plan is parked until routing is done (memory: Mono parked), so this is the ready-to-build state, not a request to start.

### 6.1 M5 build (2026-10-20)

Steps a), b) and the worker part of c) are built behind `[MonoThread] GcLock=1`, `FrameTls=1`, `Mode=1` (all off by default): the 19 P3 sites, P4, and an idle registered worker; selftest and byte checks pass; no game run, no monohost run yet. Details, tests and risks: docs/30 §14; ledger docs/51 §148 (I-120-7 to I-120-12).

## 7. Ledger

Open claims are in docs/51 §141 (I-120-1 to I-120-6). Closed statically 2026-10-20: I-120-2 (refuted) and I-120-3 (§2.2.1), I-120-6 (§3.3.1).

## 8. M5 offline proof in monohost (2026-10-20, G-A2 groundwork)

**Setup.** `native/monohost` links `native/ts3native/monothread.cpp` (which includes `monothread-m5.cpp`) unchanged, inside a namespace that supplies the four ts3native helpers and the counter fields it uses. After the M1.4/M1.5 steps the selftest hands `[0x11949CC]` back to Boehm's push, writes a `[MonoThread] Enabled=1 Mode=1 GcLock=1 FrameTls=1` ini, calls `ApplyMonoThread` and then `MtTick` from the host's main thread (as the sim thread). So the code under test is the M5 build itself: P1 registration, P2 root push, the 19 P3 sites, the P4 frame TLS blocks and the worker entry (`MtSubmit`, `0xE5A600`). Host-side additions: the exe's static TLS block for threads started later (host TLS callback; the exe now uses TLS index 63 and the loader's vector is kept and restored at thread exit, after a 2-entry vector crashed dbghelp/gdi32full/ntdll at worker exit), and a counting detour at `0xD8A8E0`. Managed jobs are in `HostTest.cs` (`WorkerGraph`, `WorkerMin`, results in statics). Runs: selftest x3 (28/28), plus 4 runs with the concurrent jobs (one `selftest ... m5concurrent`, three of a build that ran them by default). No game, no Steam. Claim ids I-120-13 to I-120-17 in docs/51 §152.

| Check | Result | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `ApplyMonoThread` accepts the mapped exe (all byte checks pass); first tick: the host thread is already in Boehm's table (index 0), P3 19 sites, P4 `0xF` (TLS slots 20/21), worker state 2 within the wait | verified (run x6) |
| **Worker alone** (`M5-worker-alone`) | main thread idle; the worker builds a 400-node graph held only by its own frame, 1,000 rounds of 300-node churn plus a sum check, `GC.Collect()` every 64 rounds: **1,000/1,000 clean, 15 collections run on the worker, and P2 pushed the suspended main thread's stack at each one**; ~220-330 ms | verified (run x6) |
| Stop (`M5-stop`) | `mtMode` 0 + `MtTick`: worker unregisters and exits (state 4), gate 0, no stop failure, no worker exception; the M1.4-style handle graph (1,000 nodes) intact after all jobs | verified (run x3) |
| **Both threads interpreting** (`m5concurrent` job A, `MinLoop`: float compares, no allocation in the loop) | **fails**: 3 of 4 runs fault on the worker at `0xE5444D` (`cmp eax,[edx]`, edx = state `+0x13C` = 0: the frame-exit arena check of `0xE53EB0` finds no arena chain on the worker's outermost state although the frame came from arena memory); 1 run hung (worker never finished in 60 s). An earlier build passed this job once (62 ms) | verified (fault, hang); cause open |
| Both threads allocating (job B, worker graph + main churn and a collection per pass) | **fails** within 16-200 ms: `IndexOutOfRangeException` at `stelem.ref` in `Build` (an array's length changed under the worker), `NullReferenceException` right after a field store in `Churn`, or one corrupt sum. With 215 collections in one long run, still corrupt | verified (run) |
| `0xD8A8E0` (F1 question) | **0 entries on either thread** in every job: in the host `Math.Min(float)` is plain corlib IL, because EA's binder bodies (`0xE3E570`, docs/122 §12.1) are not registered; the cursor `[0x11EE5A4]` is 0 (never reset to the sentinel, `0xD9A520` not run) | verified (counter) |

**Verdicts.**

1. **GC side of M5 holds where it was tested:** a worker registered by P1 runs managed code under the P3 lock, its own collections stop the main thread, and P2 pushes that thread's registers and stack; nothing was lost over 15 worker-run collections (I-120-13, I-120-14). Collections run by the main thread while the worker is inside managed code were only seen together with the interpreter fault below, so "the worker's stack is scanned by a main-thread collection" is **not yet proven** (I-120-15).
2. **The interpreter is not yet safe on two threads, with or without allocation** (I-120-16). The fault is in frame bookkeeping, not in the collector: a frame's arena memory and its state's chain (`+0x13C`) disagree. P4 moves only `[0x11F4170]`/`[0x11F416C]`; the remaining shared candidates are docs/56 §2's list (EA pair `[0x11F4158]`/`[0x11F415C]`, thunk hash `[0x11F4128]`, `0xE50F90` typed descriptors) and the arena trio `0xD71900`/`0xD71A20`/`0xD71B70`, whose chunk list `[0x11EE508]` is locked by P3 but whose use by the interpreter's inline bump (`0xE563B2`-`0xE563D1`) is not. **M5 Mode=1 must not run a job while the sim thread interprets** until this is found; the in-game Mode=1 idle worker (no job) is unaffected.
3. **F1 (docs/122 §12.5): confirmed statically, not reproducible in this host.** Bytes of `0xD8A830`/`0xD8A8E0`: `[0x11EE5A4]` is a cursor into one chain of preallocated call records (node: `+0` next, `+4` prev, `+8` record `0x150`, `+0xC` buffer `0x28`; sentinel `0x11944C8`, tail `[0x11944CC]`, nodes from the pool at `0x11944D0`). Entry takes the record at the cursor and moves it forward; exit moves it back one (`0xD8A9A5`). Interleaved on two threads (A in, B in, A out, A in) the cursor hands B's live record to A: **two interpreters on one record** = crash, as docs/122 said (I-120-17, mechanism verified from bytes; live proof needs EA's binder table in the host). **F1 design (unchanged in intent, now concrete):** a detour at `0xD8A8E0` (5 bytes `8B 44 24 18 53`, no relative operand) that sends only the worker to a host copy of the two functions on a worker-private chain (own sentinel and cursor, nodes from the CRT, the two record buffers from `GC_malloc_uncollectable` so they stay roots and go through the P3 lock), same record fill, `0xE85040`, `0xE53EB0`, clear and step back; the sim thread keeps the game's code. A host prototype of this path was written and removed again because nothing in the host calls `0xD8A8E0`; it belongs in ts3native with `[Verify]`'s shared stub (docs/122 §12.4) and a two-thread selftest on a fake chain.

**Next (G-A2):** find the shared state behind the `0xE5444D` fault: run job A with a watch on the worker's state `+0x13C` and on `[0x11EE508]`, and with P3's arena trio counters per thread; then repeat jobs A and B (`selftest ... m5concurrent`) until both pass three times. Then register EA's binder table in the host (or call `0xD8A8E0` with a recorded argument set) for a live F1 proof.


## 9. The `0xE5444D` cause, the arena pool fix and F1 live (2026-10-20, G-A2)

Host runs only (`native/monohost` selftest on the `game-copy/monohost` exe copy), capstone reads of the exe bytes, no game, no Steam. Ledger docs/51 §157 (I-120-15 verified, I-120-16 closed, I-120-17 live, I-120-1 answered live, new I-120-18 to I-120-22).

### 9.1 Cause: one chunk in two states, from a double release in EA's frame arena

The interpreter's frame memory (locals, arguments, eval stack of each frame) is bump-allocated from a chain of 0x7FC-byte chunks per interpreter state (state `+0x13C` = current chunk; chunk `+0` top, `+4` end, `+8` previous chunk, data from `+0xC`). Chunks come from one process-wide pool `[0x11EE508]` (circular list of nodes: `+0` prev, `+4` next, `+8` chunk) and go back to it when a frame exit pops a chunk to its data start (`0xD71A20`) or when a state is freed (`0xD71B70`, release all) [verified bytes]. The inline bump (`0xE563B2`-`0xE563D1`) and the inline pop (`0xE54437`-`0xE54451`, `0xE59800`-`0xE59811`) touch only the state's own chunk; the pool is only touched by `0xD71900`/`0xD71A20`/`0xD71B70` (P3-locked) and the shutdown path `0xD80AF3` [verified, operand scan of the whole `.text`].

- **Bug [verified bytes]:** `0xD71B70` pushes every chunk of the chain back to the pool but never clears `+0x13C`. A finished task state is freed twice by EA's own flow: the interpreter frees it when the task ends (`0xE59FD0` -> `0xE52DD0`, sites `0xE5A4FD`/`0xE5A53E`/`0xE5A589`/`0xE5A5A4`) and `ScriptHost_RunTask` frees it again (`0xD7F166` -> `0xE53E80` -> `0xE52DD0`) [verified callers]. Normally the chain is already empty by then (every frame popped), so the second call does nothing. A task that ends with a managed exception leaves frames on the chain; the first free pools the chunk, the second pools it again.
- **Seen in the host [verified, arena call trace]:** M1.5's `SleepInCctor` task (yield refused in a `.cctor`, `TypeInitializationException` out of the task) took chunk C, then two release-all calls on the same state both found C on the chain: the pool held C twice from then on (pool walk: 65 nodes, 1 duplicate, after M1.5; 0 before). In job A the main thread's invocation took C and the worker's took the next node, C again; both bumped frames into the same chunk. The worker's frame exit then found its chain emptied by the other state's pop (fault at `0xE5444D`, `+0x13C` = 0), or its locals were overwritten (the "job ends in 8-19 us with result 0" runs). Job B's corrupt sums and exceptions in docs/120 §8 are the same shared chunk.
- **Not a missing TLS move [verified]:** operand census of the interpreter core `0xE52000`-`0xE5A700`: the only written absolute globals are the TLS key `[0x11F4160]` (init), `[0x11F4164]` (init/shutdown), the runtime-method hash `[0x11F4168]` (created under `0x11F4130`) and P4's `[0x11F4170]`/`[0x11F416C]`; reads are init-time flags (`[0x11F4148]`, `[0x11F414C]`, `[0x11F4154]`) and `mono_defaults` class pointers (`0x1220E68`-`0x1220EE4`). No other `0x11F4170`/`0x11F416C` reference exists in the exe. This matches docs/56 §2; the arena pool is the only shared mutable state the frame path uses, and P3 already locks its three functions. docs/56's other shared items stay as they were (thunk hash `[0x11F4128]` covered by the warm-up rule, `0xE50F90` typed descriptors, call-record cursor = F1).
- **In the game [inferred]:** the same double release happens whenever a script task ends with an exception while frames are on its chain. With one thread the duplicate bites only when two states are live at once (a native-to-managed call nested inside a script call takes the second copy); with the M5 worker two live states are the normal case. How often game tasks end that way is unmeasured (I-120-22).

### 9.2 Fix (`[MonoThread] ArenaFix=1`, default 1, active only with `GcLock=1`)

In `monothread-m5.cpp`, chained into P3's trampoline slots, so it runs on both gate paths (with or without the lock):

| Part | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| clear after release-all | `0xD71B70` slot | run the original, then `state+0x13C = 0`; counts calls that found a non-empty chain (`arenaRelNonEmpty`) |
| dedupe at install | P3 install (sim thread, tick boundary) | walk the pool once, unlink later nodes whose chunk is already listed |
| heal before grow | `0xD71900` slot | while the pool head's chunk is in use (top != data start; every release path resets top [verified bytes]), unlink that node; counts `arenaDropped` |

The heal covers a duplicate created before install whose other copy is live in a suspended task. Counters: `ts3native_mtprobe` v2 (`arenaRelNonEmpty` +0x6C, `arenaDropped` +0x70, docs/registry.md). Selftest `TestMonoThreadM5`: fake pool A B A C B -> dedupe drops 2; A and B in use -> heal drops both; release-all wrapper clears `+0x13C` and a second free is harmless.

### 9.3 Host results (monohost selftest, 33 checks, default run)

| Check | Result | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| `M5-arena-dedupe` | 1 duplicate before install (M1.5's task), 1 node dropped, 0 after | verified (run x10) |
| `M5-arena-release` | a second exception task after install (`SleepInCctor2`): release-all of a non-empty chain 1, 0 duplicates after | verified (run x10) |
| `M5-concurrent-noalloc` (job A) | 5 rounds of `MinLoop(400000)` on the worker while the main thread loops `MinLoop(5000)`: 0 wrong results either side, ~410-460 main passes, shortest worker run 55-72 ms (was 8-19 us or a fault) | verified (run x10) |
| `M5-concurrent-alloc` (job B, I-120-15) | 400-node graph only on the worker's frame intact over 3,000 rounds while the main thread allocates and collects: ~800 collections, ~755 of them run by the main thread, P2 stacks pushed = collections (each main-run collection pushes the worker's suspended stack) | verified (run x10) |
| `M5-n2m-private` (F1, §9.4) | 5 rounds through `0xD8A8E0` on both threads: 0 wrong results, ~430 main entries on the game's chain, 5 worker entries on private records, cursor balanced | verified (run x4) |
| `M5-stop` | worker stops, 0 pool duplicates, 12 jobs | verified (run x10) |
| negative control `MONOHOST_ARENAFIX=0` | dedupe/release FAIL; job A: worker runs of 8 us (1 run) or the `0xE5444D` fault (1 run) | verified (run x2) |

Runs: 6 before the F1 job was added (32/32) and 4 of the final build (33/33), exit 0, ~10 s each; 3 more F1 runs passed every check except a wrong cursor expectation in the test itself (fixed: the idle cursor is the first free node, not the sentinel). `selftest <hostdata> m5concurrent` is no longer needed: the concurrent jobs are in the default run.

### 9.4 F1 live: the hazard and the private records (`[MonoThread] N2mPrivate=1`, default 1, with `GcLock=1`)

**Host setup:** a host internal call `MonoHostTest.HostTest::N2mMinLoop` enters the interpreter the way EA's binder bodies do: `0xD8A8E0(RuntimeMethod of MinLoop, this, stackval args, stackval ret, &exc, this thread's ThreadContext)` (signature read from the bytes: args at `+4`..`+0x18`, cdecl, no return value [verified]). The cursor `[0x11EE5A4]` starts at the sentinel `0x11944C8` as `0xD9A520` sets it in the game (sentinel and node allocator `0x11944D0` are initialised in the image's data [verified bytes]).

- **Hazard [verified, run x4]:** with `MONOHOST_F1=0` (game code on both threads) the first round faults (`0xE53F4D`, `0xE584B1`, `0xD8A95B`, `0xE54406`) and the main thread's calls return corrupt exceptions (`System.AppDomainSetup` thrown). Both threads ran on records handed out by one cursor.
- **Fix [verified, run x7]:** a 5-byte detour at `0xD8A8E0` (`8B 44 24 18 53`, no relative operand) compares the thread id with the worker's (`fs:[0x24]`); the worker runs the same body on a private stack of records (32 levels, 0x150 record + 0x28 buffer from `GC_malloc_uncollectable`, so they are roots and their allocation goes through the P3 lock): same fill, `0xE85040`, `0xE53EB0`, exception out, buffer and record cleared, buffer link restored. A full private stack or a failed allocation returns to the game's path and counts `n2mOverflow` (tripwire). The sim thread runs the game's code unchanged. Counters `n2mReady`, `n2mWorker`, `n2mMaxDepth`, `n2mOverflow` (v2, +0x74..+0x80). Selftest: fake exec nests 2 deep (distinct records, field fill, exception out, cleared after), overflow refused.
- **Install order:** `[Verify]`'s `nativeToManaged` stub owns `0xD8A8E0` when it is on; F1 installs at the first Simulate tick and finds changed bytes, so it skips with a log line. Running both needs F1 to chain into `[Verify]`'s stub (docs/122 §12.4) — not built.

### 9.5 Verdicts and next

1. **I-120-16 closed:** the shared state behind `0xE5444D` is EA's frame arena pool, poisoned by a double release; with `ArenaFix=1` two threads interpret at once with and without allocation, 10 of 10 runs clean.
2. **I-120-15 verified:** collections run by the main thread while the worker is inside managed code push the worker's stack, and a graph held only there survives ~755 of them per run.
3. **I-120-1 answered live** (job `bp-mt-p1`, ts3native 0.35.20, `[MonoThread] Enabled=1 Mode=0`): first-tick log "sim thread 32704 already registered (main 18852)", counters `mtReady` 7, `mtSimTid` 32704, `mtThreads` 1, `mtSimRegistered` 0. Boehm's table holds the **sim thread** (`GC_init` ran there), not the main thread, and it is the only registered thread: P1 has nothing to add for the sim thread, and P2/stop-the-world see exactly the sim thread plus the worker in Mode=1 [verified live]. This matches the host setup, where the host's main thread plays the sim thread and is table index 0.
4. **I-120-17 live:** the F1 hazard crashes in the host; `N2mPrivate=1` fixes it for the worker.
5. **Next (M5 -> M6):** the ts3fixes `MtProbe` job + Verify mode in game; F1 chained with `[Verify]`; measure how often game tasks end with a non-empty chain (`arenaRelNonEmpty` per hour, I-120-22) — if often, `ArenaFix` is worth having without the worker too (a separate single-thread switch).

## 10. I-120-8 static audit: does the P3 return-address swap fit all 17 entries? (2026-10-20)

Static only (no game run, no build). P3 (docs/30 §14.1, `monothread-m5.cpp` `MtLockEnter` / `MtLockExitThunk`) replaces each hooked call's return address with a thunk and keeps the real one on a global shadow stack (`g_mtRet[g_mtDepth]`) that the recursive `g_mtLock` guards. That is correct only if the hooked function (1) never reads its own return slot, (2) leaves only through a return that reaches the thunk (a tail jump is fine: the target returns to the thunk), and (3) is never left by `longjmp` or an SEH unwind while the lock is held. `tools/p3-entry-audit.py` disassembles each entry (capstone 5, Steam 1.67 `TS3W.exe`, Ghidra function bounds), tracks the stack offset of the return slot, lists exits, tail jumps, `fs:[0]` frames and indirect calls, and walks the direct-call closure to depth 6. The callback slots it finds were then followed by hand.

All [verified: tool output + hand reads of the named sites]. No entry has an `fs:[0]` frame, none reads its return slot (no `[esp+off]` at the slot offset, no `[ebp+4]`, no copy of `esp` used as a pointer), and the three tail jumps land in functions that end in a plain `ret` and do not read the slot either.

### 10.2 The one unwind out of a locked entry: `GC_oom_fn` -> managed `OutOfMemoryException` -> `longjmp`

- `mono_gc_base_init` (`0xE69570`) stores `0xE78610` into `GC_oom_fn` `[0x11949BC]` at `0xE695A2` (the static value `0x5BFB90` is a `return 0`) [verified].
- `0xE78610` reads the domain's preallocated out-of-memory exception (domain `+0x2C`) and calls `mono_raise_exception` `0xEA18F0`, which calls the handler in `[0x1195B64]` [verified].
- The interpreter sets that handler to `0xE53740` at `0xE5A70F` (the static default `0xEA18A0` prints "Exception %s.%s raised in C code" and exits) [verified].
- `0xE53740` takes the thread's interpreter context from TLS `[0x11F4160]`; with a context and a saved `jmp_buf` it calls MSVCR80 **`longjmp`** (`0xE537B2`, import `0xF95704`) to the interpreter frame's `setjmp3` (docs/120 summary) [verified]. Without a context it returns, `0xE78610` returns 0 and the allocation returns NULL.
- `GC_generic_malloc` calls `GC_oom_fn` only after the inner allocation and the collection/expansion retries failed, so this is the **heap-exhausted path** [verified for the call site; the retry order is stock Boehm, community-reported].

Effect with the gate on: the `longjmp` skips every thunk between the interpreter frame and the GC frame (two when `GC_malloc` reached `GC_generic_malloc` through its own hook). `g_mtLock` stays entered once per skipped thunk and `g_mtRet` keeps those entries. The next locked exit on that thread pops a stale return address and jumps into a dead frame (crash), and the other thread blocks on the lock for good (hang). This is the address-space-exhaustion case the project exists to make rarer (Error 12), so it is not a theoretical path; without P3 the same OOM is an ordinary managed exception that script code may survive.

Other unwind sources, all ruled out [verified]:

- The only SEH frame in any closure is `GC_mark_some` `0xE4D460` (`__try`/`__except` on `0xC0000005`, string "Caught ACCESS_VIOLATION in marker"): its handler at `0xE4D4AF` restores `esp` inside the same function and carries on, so an unwind stops below every hooked frame, and its marker closure (`0xE4D270`, 4 functions by direct call) reaches no hooked entry.
- No closure imports `RtlUnwind`, `RaiseException`, `_CxxThrowException`, `longjmp` or `setjmp`; the CRT `exit` import (GC abort paths) ends the process, which no lock state survives anyway.
- The other callback slots: warn proc `[0x11949C0]` (Mono sets `0xE69550`, a log call, at `0xE695AC`); `[0x11F309C]` and `[0x11F3098]` are only called when `[0x11F3094]` is non-zero, and no instruction in `.text` writes any of the three; `[0x1194830]` is `0xE4A410`, a heap-object print used by leak/smash reports. None unwinds.

### 10.3 Verdict and fix

- **I-120-8: refuted for one path, holds otherwise.** 7 of 17 entries fit outright; the other 10 fit on every path except the heap-exhausted `GC_oom_fn` path, which `longjmp`s out of the locked frame.
- **Fix [design, not built]:** store the return-slot address with each shadow entry (`g_mtSlot[d] = retSlot`). Stack frames nest, so a live outer hooked frame always has a higher slot address than any inner one. In `MtLockEnter`, drop (and `LeaveCriticalSection` once for) every top entry whose slot address is at or below the new `retSlot`; in `MtLockLeave`, drop every top entry whose slot is below the returning frame's slot (`esp - 4` at thunk entry) before popping. A frame abandoned by any unwind is then cleaned up at the thread's next hooked entry or exit. Add a `lockStale` counter. Cheaper alternative: wrap `GC_oom_fn` (write our function into `[0x11949BC]` while the gate is on) to release this thread's lock depth and clear its shadow entries before calling `0xE78610`. That covers only the known path; the slot rule covers any unwind. Selftest: a fake hooked entry that `longjmp`s to its caller twice, then a normal locked call; expect `lockStale` 2, depth 0, the right return address.
- Until the fix is in, `lockOverflow`/`lockMaxDepth` (the I-120-8 live test) would not show this leak, because no OOM happens in a normal 10-minute load. The live check should add an OOM case or wait for the fix.

Reproduce: `python tools/p3-entry-audit.py <repo>/game-copy/bin/TS3W.exe <repo>/game-copy/analysis/functions.csv` (17 blocks; the `GC_oom_fn` line names the function that calls the slot), then capstone at `0xE695A2`, `0xE78610`, `0xEA18F0`, `0xE5A70A`, `0xE53740`, `0xE4D460`. Ledger: docs/51 §173.
